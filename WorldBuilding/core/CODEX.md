This document serves as the canonical reference for the GLSS-based worldbuilding universe. It contains foundational theory, link mechanics, detection models, and system behaviors for the network of Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities (GLSS), also known as Jump Points (JPs).

## 1.0 Theoretical Wormhole Mechanics (GLSS Rules)

### 1.1 What is a GLSS?
A **Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularity** (GLSS) is a naturally forming, stable wormhole created by large-scale gravitational resonance between stars. These jump points enable instantaneous interstellar travel.

---

## 2.0 GLSS Formation Rules

### 2.1 Mass and Distance Criteria
- GLSS links form based on gravitational interactions between systems.
- More massive systems generate stronger Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP), increasing link likelihood.
- Links tend to form between systems within **20 light-years** of each other, with **closer links favored**.

### 2.2 Resonant Mass Coupling
- Systems with **similar stellar masses** (within ~10–15%) are more likely to form links due to resonance effects.
- Systems with high total mass may link to several smaller systems to balance cluster-wide mass.

### 2.3 Link Types
- **Primary Links**: Form between anchor systems and are high-RGP, early detectable.
- **Secondary/Support Links**: Lower RGP, found later or used for redundancy.
- **Theoretical Links**: Below detection threshold but still gravitationally valid.

---

## 3.0 Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP)

### 3.1 Core Concept
- Formerly called "gravitational leakage," RGP is the pull experienced across a GLSS from one system to another.
- It is **directional and asymmetric**, depending on the **remote system's mass**.

### 3.2 Formula

$\text{RGP} = \left( \frac{M_{\text{remote}}}{D^2} \right) \times \varepsilon$

Where:
- \( M \): Mass of the remote system (in solar masses)
- \( D \): Distance in light-years
- \( arepsilon \): Leakage transmission efficiency (typically 0.01)

### 3.3 GL Unit Definition
- **1.0 GL** is defined as the RGP from **Alpha Centauri → Sol**.
- All other RGPs are calculated relative to this baseline.

---

## 4.0 Detection and Sensor Tech

### 4.1 DGVS
**Directional Gravitational Vector Sensors (DGVS)** are the primary tool for discovering GLSS links.
- **Gen-1 Threshold**: ~0.1 GL
- **Gen-2 (Post-2220)**: ~0.065 GL
- Some links remain hidden due to:
  - Suppressed leakage
  - Lagrange point formation
  - Interference from overlapping fields

---

## 5.0 GLSS Link Behavior

### 5.1 Bi-Directional Structure
- GLSS links are structurally **bi-directional** and stable unless mass shifts significantly.
- Ships, data, and gravitational influence flow both ways.

### 5.2 Asymmetric RGP
- **RGP is not mutual**: the RGP felt at System A due to System B differs from System B’s RGP from A.
- Larger systems project more influence than they receive.

---

## 6.0 Cluster Formation and Network Topology

### 6.1 Hub and Spoke
- High-mass systems like **Sirius** and **Alpha Centauri** serve as **hubs**, linking to multiple lower-mass nodes.
- Cul-de-sac systems like **Sol** often receive links but don’t originate many.

### 6.2 Link Roles
- **Hub**: Mass-rich system with multiple outbound links (e.g., Sirius, Procyon)
- **Relay**: Mid-mass system with bidirectional links (e.g., Epsilon Eridani)
- **Terminal**: Low-mass system with one inbound or theoretical link (e.g., Ross 128)

---

## 7.0 Alignment and Traversal

- To traverse a GLSS, a ship must align its vector to the **apparent position** of the remote system as it would appear based on light-travel delay.
- Alignment requires 3D orientation and relativistic positional modeling.
- Without alignment, the GLSS remains hidden or impassable.

## 8.0 In-Universe History

- **2049**: Precursor ruins discovered on Mars
- **2073**: LeSaut Principle enables gravity manipulation
- **2184**: DGVS invented
- **2189**: Sol → Alpha Centauri GLSS detected via Planet X anomaly
- **2190**: First jump conducted
- **Post-2200**: Sirius, Procyon, and Eridani links discovered; network expands
- **2220s**: New detection threshold (~0.065 GL) enables low-RGP link discovery

---

## 9.0 System Example: Sol

- **Inbound Links**: Alpha Centauri (1.0 GL), Sirius (0.4 GL), Procyon (0.152 GL)
- **Outbound Links**: Alpha Centauri (0.499 GL), Sirius (0.13 GL)
- **Special**: Planet X anomaly explained by dual-link RGP vector convergence
