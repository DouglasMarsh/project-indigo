This document serves as the canonical reference for the GLSS-based worldbuilding universe. It contains foundational theory, link mechanics, detection models, and system behaviors for the network of Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities (GLSS), also known as Jump Points (JPs).

## 1.0 Theoretical Wormhole Mechanics (GLSS Rules)

### 1.1 What is a GLSS?
A **Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularity** (GLSS) is a naturally forming, stable wormhole created by large-scale gravitational resonance between distant star systems. GLSS form chains, exhibit Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP), and allow instantaneous interstellar transit.

---

## 2.0 Core Rules

- GLSS form based on stellar mass, proximity, and resonance (especially similar-mass stars).
- RGP is calculated as:  
  `RGP = (M / D²) × ε`  
  where ε is the leakage transmission efficiency, typically 0.001–0.01.
- All GLSS are bi-directional and require precise spatial and temporal alignment to traverse.

---

## 3.0 Alignment and Traversal

- Jump requires aligning the vessel's position vector with the projected location of the destination system, as it would appear at light-travel distance.
- Without alignment, GLSS remain undetectable.

## 4.0 Known GLSS Examples

- Sol → Alpha Centauri A: Primary link, initially misinterpreted as “Planet X”
- Sol → Sirius B: Resonant link formed from mass-match loop
- Alpha Centauri → Sirius: Confirmed strong-link based on detection leakage

---

## 5.0 Detection and Sensor Technology

- Gravitational leakage is only detectable above ~0.065 GL (updated threshold)
- DGVS (Directional Gravitational Vector Sensors) are required for precision location
- Lagrange-point GLSS may remain hidden due to suppressed leakage

---

## 6.0 Precursor Implications

- Theoretical origins of GLSS remain unknown; however, precursor ruins discovered in the Belt (Hygiea) suggest an advanced civilization may have engineered or exploited the network.
- Discovery of Cryohelion and the Tesla-LeSaut gravitic synthesis model has led to rapid acceleration in field generation and detection.

## 7.0 Cultural Interpretations

- The Order of the Nine Sparks (ONS) believes GLSS are cosmological artifacts left behind by divine “uplifters”
- Tech cults interpret the GLSS field network as an interface for spiritual transit or cosmic enlightenment
