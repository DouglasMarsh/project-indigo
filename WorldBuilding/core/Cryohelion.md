# Cryohelion

## Overview
Cryohelion is an exotic gravitic crystalline material discovered within Precursor artifacts scattered across the outer reaches of the Solar System. Naturally stable only at extreme cryogenic temperatures, Cryohelion exhibits unique resonance properties with existing GLSS (Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities), enhancing the detection of otherwise hidden wormholes.

## Physical Properties
- **Phase:** Crystalline at temperatures approaching absolute zero.
- **Appearance:** Semi-transparent lattice structures with internal gravitic harmonics detectable via specialized gravity sensors.
- **Emissions:** Mild gravitic harmonic fluctuations when stable; catastrophic ultra-high-frequency gravitonic bursts upon collapse.

## Natural vs Synthetic Cryohelion
- **Natural Cryohelion:** Found embedded within Precursor ruins, extremely limited in quantity, and highly stable under cryogenic conditions.
- **Synthetic Cryohelion:** Created by human experimentation post-LeSaut analysis. Highly unstable; prone to gravitic collapse events with devastating effects on spacetime and biological systems.

## Historical Timeline
- **2047:** Mining survey probe near Hygiea detects anomalous crystalline substance; probe and tender lost due to unknown gravitic phenomena. Later confirmed by LeSaut analysis as Cryohelion.
- **2054:** *Chrysalis Collapse* event: synthetic Cryohelion cascade failure results in massive casualties and public exposure to the dangers of gravitic resonance.
- **2093:** Successful containment breakthroughs allow for limited safe manipulation of natural Cryohelion samples.

## Strategic Significance
- **Detection Amplifier:** Cryohelion greatly enhances the ability to locate GLSS points, giving strategic exploration and colonization advantages.
- **Biological Impact:** Exposure to Cryohelion collapse emissions is linked to the emergence of psionic traits among Belter and deep space populations.
- **Containment Protocols:** EXOS and other factions have established strict guidelines for the storage, study, and use of Cryohelion samples, including Cryohelion Damping Cells and exposure quarantine zones.

## Dangers
- **Collapse Events:** Synthetic Cryohelion collapses release gravitonic bursts capable of localized spacetime distortion and mass casualty events.
- **Neural Mutation:** High-intensity exposure can restructure neural pathways, leading to unpredictable psionic phenomena, neurological damage, or death.

## Cultural and Mythic Interpretations
- Some fringe groups within the Order of the Nine Sparks view Cryohelion as "the Frozen Breath of the Makers," a sacred remnant of divine cosmic architecture.
- Psionic cults emerging from affected deep-space populations often revere Cryohelion collapse sites as places of spiritual awakening or forbidden power.

## Conclusion
Cryohelion remains one of the most enigmatic and consequential materials discovered in humanity's expansion into space. Its dual nature as both a beacon for exploration and a vector for biological and societal transformation ensures it occupies a central place in the scientific, political, and mythological landscape of the new frontier.
