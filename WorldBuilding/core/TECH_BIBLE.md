# TECH BIBLE

This document contains the scientific, technological, and theoretical frameworks underlying the GLSS-based universe, including the mechanics of gravity manipulation, remote gravitational pull (RGP), and interstellar traversal.

## 1.0 Foundational Concepts

### 1.1 GLSS (Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities)
- Naturally occurring wormholes connecting distant star systems.
- Bi-directional and stable unless system mass changes drastically.
- Most commonly form in high-mass systems or those with resonant mass coupling.

### 1.2 Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP)
- The measurable pull one star system exerts on another via a GLSS.
- Replaces the term "gravitational leakage".
- Not mutual: larger systems produce more RGP, smaller systems feel more pull.

## 2.0 Gravity Manipulation Technology

### 2.1 Historical Milestones
- **2049**: Precursor ruins discovered on Mars.
- **2073**: LeSaut Principle unlocked after reverse-engineering alien gravitic cores.
- **2080s**: Functional gravitic field manipulation becomes commercially viable.

### 2.2 Applications
- **Gravitic Drives**: Reactionless propulsion by shifting local gravity vectors.
- **Artificial Gravity**: Used aboard ships and orbital habitats.
- **Containment Fields**: Used in fusion reactors, black site research, and precusor study.
- **Shielding Systems**: Redirect or absorb energy and projectiles.

### 2.3 Inertial Compensation
- Allows acceleration beyond G-force survival limits.
- Cutting-edge military: 10:1 max ratio, 3:1 typical
- Commercial craft: 5:1 max, 1.5–2:1 common

## 3.0 Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP)

### 3.1 RGP Formula

$\text{RGP} = \left( \frac{M_{\text{remote}}}{D^2} \right) \times \varepsilon$

- \( M \): mass of the remote system (in solar masses)
- \( D \): distance between systems (in light-years)
- \( \varepsilon \): transmission efficiency, typically 0.01

### 3.2 GL Standard
- 1 GL is defined as the RGP from **Alpha Centauri → Sol**.
- All other RGP values are scaled accordingly.

### 3.3 Behavior
- RGP is directional and asymmetric.
- Multiple RGP vectors in close proximity can interfere (e.g. Planet X dual-link zone).

## 4.0 GLSS Detection

### 4.1 Sensor Types
- **DGVS**: Directional Gravitational Vector Sensors
- Measures minute RGP fluctuations across 3D space.

### 4.2 Detection Thresholds
- **Gen-1 DGVS** (2184): ~0.1 GL
- **Gen-2 DGVS** (2220): ~0.065 GL
- Suppressed links near Lagrange points may fall below 0.01 GL

### 4.3 Discovery Factors
- Alignment vector required for detection and traversal
- Sensor sensitivity, survey duration, and precursor assistance all increase success rate

---

## 5.0 Starship Systems

### 5.1 Traversal Requirements
- Full 3D orientation based on relativistic projection of the target star's position
- Navigation systems compensate for light-travel delay and gravitational time dilation
- Misalignment prevents GLSS from opening

### 5.2 Power & Field Systems
- Field generation consumes massive energy during alignment phase
- RGP-stabilizers onboard to match ambient gravitational vector before jump

---

## 6.0 Precursor Theory

### 6.1 Ruins & Artifacts
- Gravitic architecture discovered on Mars, Belt fragments, and outer-system moons
- Suggests knowledge of GLSS dynamics long before human development

### 6.2 Stabilization Theory
- Some links (especially low-leakage or cluster edge cases) may require precursor-built stabilizers
- These systems may include field resonators, mass anchors, or tunneling nodes

---

## 7.0 Advanced Concepts

### 7.1 Resonant Mass Coupling
- Stars with similar mass more likely to form stable GLSS
- Supports symmetrical link patterns and cluster anchoring

### 7.2 Multi-Star Clustering
- GLSS links may emerge to "balance" mass across a local stellar neighborhood
- Systems with more than two links may act as gateways or phase locks
