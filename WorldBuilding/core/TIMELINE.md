# TIMELINE OF EVENTS

This document outlines the technological, political, and exploratory history of the GLSS-connected universe. It includes the development of gravity manipulation, sensor technology, and the discovery of major interstellar links.

## 21st Century: Precursor Revelation & Early Breakthroughs

- **2049** – First human mission to Mars discovers buried Precursor ruins with gravitic technology.
- **2050s–2060s** – International secrecy agreements and joint excavation efforts begin.
- **2073** – The LeSaut Principle is published, enabling manipulation of localized gravity fields.
- **2080s** – Gravitic containment and artificial gravity systems enter experimental use.
- **2090s** – Early orbital platforms and military craft use reactionless drives; Belter society begins to take shape.

## 22nd Century: The Age of GLSS Discovery

- **2184** – DGVS (Directional Gravitational Vector Sensors) developed; first sensor capable of detecting weak RGP fields.
- **2189** – Sol → Alpha Centauri GLSS discovered through analysis of the Planet X anomaly.
- **2190** – First successful jump conducted from Sol to Alpha Centauri. Interstellar Age begins.
- **2195** – Alpha Centauri → Sirius link detected due to high RGP vector field.
- **2200–2205** – Sirius → Procyon and Sirius → Sol discovered through targeted scanning missions.

## Post-2205: Expansion and Detection Evolution

- **2210–2220** – Improved DGVS systems allow detection of RGP values down to 0.065 GL.
- **2225–2240** – Epsilon Eridani chain expands to include Lalande 21185 and Ross 128.
- **2240s** – Theoretical links from Tau1 Eridani modeled; some confirmed.
- **2250–2270** – Deep-field scanning identifies low-RGP connections and outlines multi-cluster structure.

## Political and Factional Evolution

- **2090–2120** – Earth-based governments weaken; megacorporations and ONS begin to dominate outer space.
- **2130s** – EXOS founded to coordinate exploration, enforcement, and precursor study.
- **2160s–2180s** – Spacer nations and Mars unions push for autonomy; Belter fleets become self-governing.
- **Post-2190** – GLSS hubs become points of contention for control and influence.

## Current Status

- Multiple confirmed and theoretical GLSS links
- RGP detection stable down to ~0.065 GL
- Several frontier systems still unmapped or unstable
- Precursor influence remains a mystery
