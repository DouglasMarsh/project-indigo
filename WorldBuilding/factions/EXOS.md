# EXOS — Expeditionary Operations Service

## Overview

The **Expeditionary Operations Service (EXOS)** is a post-national, science-forward organization tasked with exploration, peacekeeping, and stabilization across human-inhabited and Precursor-affected systems.

Originally formed as a joint mission response unit during the Hygiea Siege, EXOS evolved into a permanent interstellar agency after repeated jurisdictional failures by Earth-bound powers.

## Core Functions

- **Wormhole Reconnaissance and Mapping**  
  Locates and charts GLSS phenomena in active and latent states.

- **Ruins Containment and Analysis**  
  Manages Precursor site access, artifact stabilization, and cross-faction research agreements.

- **System Stabilization**  
  Deploys multirole task forces to politically volatile or high-tech spillover zones.

- **Scientific Oversight and Ethics Enforcement**  
  Operates tribunals and review panels on the use of Precursor-derived technologies.

## Political Alignment

EXOS is often viewed as an ideological foil to both megacorporate militaries and spiritual GLSS cults. Its internal code emphasizes:

- **Scientific transparency**
- **Technological containment**
- **Autonomous intervention authority**

---

## Internal Divisions

- **Survey Division** — Handles astrophysical and GLSS topology mapping.
- **Diplomatic Branch** — Negotiates temporary alliances, peace corridors, and inter-factional truces.
- **Gravitic Risk Directorate** — Focused on Precursor technology, Cryohelion research, and mass-leak containment.

## EXOS Reputation

EXOS is regarded with mixed sentiment across systems:

- To fringe colonies and researchers: a safeguard and neutral arbiter
- To Terra Prima and anti-corporate factions: another distant elite enforcing “off-world agendas”
- To megacorps: a bureaucratic obstacle that occasionally turns into a military one
