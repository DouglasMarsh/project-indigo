# Frontier Defense Alliance (FDA)

## Overview
The Frontier Defense Alliance (FDA) is a loosely federated coalition of asteroid mining claims, independent orbital habitats, and post-collapse stakeholders. It emerged in the chaotic aftermath of planetary government collapse, when resource access and survival became more important than centralized control.

---

## Structure
- **Governance:** Minimalist — member states retain autonomy; decisions made by rotating councils.
- **Military:** Volunteer and militia-based. Resource-strapped but innovative.
- **Legal Foundation:** Based on legacy claim rights from the early expansion period.
- **Economic Profile:** Resource-rich but capital-poor. Strong in extraction, weak in logistics and defense.

---

## Strategic Philosophy
- **Decentralized Resistance:** Opposes megacorporate consolidation.
- **Survival First:** Prioritizes practical solutions over ideological purity.
- **Borderline Legality:** Known to harbor black market trade and unlicensed precursor salvage.

## Role in the Battle of Kastra Reach
- Maintained and operated Arc Signal Station K-6, a gravitic research hub near Kastra Reach.
- Was drawn into a fleet engagement by the UCC’s deployment of *Resolute*.
- Lost control of K-6 when UCC operatives infiltrated the station — but successfully purged critical Cryohelion research data.

## Assets
- Arc Signal Station K-6: Now compromised, but once a premier research node.
- Delmas Station: Financially crippled but symbolically important FDA-aligned habitat.
- Black Market Network: Includes unlicensed trade, precursor tech salvage, and off-ledger manufacturing.

## Reputation
- Seen by sympathizers as the last bastion of independence in a corporatized system.
- Portrayed by UCC media as lawless, fragmented, and dangerous.
- Internally, viewed as a fragile but necessary coalition keeping megacorporate dominance at bay.
