# Order of the Nine Sparks (ONS)

## Overview

The **Order of the Nine Sparks** is a mystic-scientific sect that emerged after the public confirmation of Precursor ruins and gravitational field technology. ONS combines rigorous field research with spiritual interpretation of cosmic phenomena, particularly GLSS (Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities).

They believe that humanity is entering a stage of *gravitic awakening* — a process seeded by the Precursors and catalyzed by exposure to active GLSS networks.

## Core Beliefs

- **Precursors were Architects of Human Ascension**  
  Humanity was chosen, uplifted, or aligned with a galactic purpose.

- **The Nine Sparks**  
  Symbolic representation of nine known (or prophesied) GLSS links that represent spiritual trials, lessons, or revelations.

- **Spacetime is Sacrament**  
  Jump points and wormhole traversal are not merely technological feats but *rituals* of metaphysical significance.

## Organizational Structure

- **The Convocation**: Central council of high-order interpreters and theorists
- **Circuit Disciples**: Field teams embedded in science crews or pilgrimage routes
- **Tithe Archives**: Repositories of annotated Precursor data, oral myths, and decoded starpath glyphs

---

## Practices and Rituals

- **Alignment Ceremonies**: Prior to GLSS traversal, especially first jumps
- **Scripted Calculations**: Ritualized navigation equations done by hand to “honor the Architects”
- **Symbolic Resonance Matching**: Use of harmonic tones and crystal matrices during field study

---

## Cultural Influence

ONS has become a significant faction in:
- Deep system research teams
- Gravitic engineering guilds
- Independent cults and revivalist offshoots

They are both revered and ridiculed depending on the system.

---

## Known Doctrinal Schisms

- **Revivalist Sparks**: Favor aggressive GLSS activation to summon Precursor return
- **Harmonicists**: Seek to replicate Precursor field harmonics in meditation and biosphere design
- **Archive-Only Orders**: Consider contact lost and advocate only for data preservation

## GLSS and the Divine

For the Order, GLSS are not just links between stars — they are bridges between consciousness and cosmic intent. To pass through a Jump Point is to enter a divine aperture.
