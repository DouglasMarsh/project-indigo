# Private Military Forces (PMFs)

## Overview

**Private Military Forces (PMFs)** are militarized subsidiaries or contracted security arms of major megacorporations operating beyond Earth. While nominally independent, most PMFs function as corporate enforcers, maintaining control over high-value orbital assets, resource zones, and GLSS-adjacent territories.

Their operations blur the line between private security and state-scale force projection.

## Core Roles

- **Orbital Asset Protection**  
  Defend corporate habitats, refineries, and GLSS beacons from sabotage or insurgent activity.

- **Intervention and Suppression**  
  Deploy to quash labor strikes, insurrections, or unauthorized archaeological digs.

- **Escort and Extraction**  
  Provide secure transit for executive assets, precursor tech, or volatile gravitic materials.

## Deployment Reach

- **Cislunar Space**: High-concentration of permanent PMF garrisons protecting megafacilities
- **Belt Zones**: Patrols on Vesta, Ceres, Hygiea, and various industrial colonies
- **Threshold Worlds**: Early-stage GLSS systems with unstable political zones

## Notable PMFs

- **AEGIS Operative Solutions**  
  Emphasizes kinetic superiority and zero-G boarding operations. Known for multi-ship coordinated maneuvers and “spark suppression” tactics against GLSS cultists.

- **SDEC (Spatial Defense Engineering Corps)**  
  Specializes in fortifications, drones, and tactical network denial. Often used to “freeze” contested orbital regions with overwhelming surveillance and jamming.

- **Sinotek Guardians**  
  Offers a public-facing peacekeeper model while maintaining a black-budget fleet. Tied to multiple Precursor ruin containment incidents.

## Equipment and Doctrine

- **Gravitic Field Suppressors**  
  Used to neutralize unregulated GLSS alignments or experimental drives.

- **Multispectral Disruption Nets**  
  Shields GLSS-linked assets from cultist sensor locks or religious broadcast interference.

- **Modular Gunships**  
  Built for long-duration patrol and sudden burst aggression. Often deployed via anchor buoys near Jump Points.

## Perception

- **Megacorps**: Reliable, if expensive, enforcement tool
- **Belters and UOWC**: Oppressive force used to suppress autonomy and exploit labor
- **EXOS**: Tactical threat and diplomatic obstacle; often requires third-party mediation

## Legal Status

Technically bound by Earth-based legal frameworks, but operate under “dynamic charter conditions” that are widely ignored outside the inner solar system.
