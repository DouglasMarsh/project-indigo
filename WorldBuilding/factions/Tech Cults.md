# Tech Cults

## Overview

**Tech Cults** are post-revelation spiritual movements that emerged after the public confirmation of Precursor ruins, gravitic anomalies, and the GLSS network. They interpret this knowledge not as purely scientific discovery, but as divine communication, metaphysical truth, or cosmic ritual.

These cults range from peaceful meditation orders to radical doomsday factions. Some are splinters of the Order of the Nine Sparks; others developed independently through exposure to leaked scientific data or Precursor relics.

## Common Themes

- **GLSS as Divine Structures**  
  Jump Points are viewed as gateways to higher planes or states of consciousness.

- **Gravitic Energy as Sacred Force**  
  Field harmonics, waveforms, and mass-induced phenomena are incorporated into ritual.

- **The Precursor Uplift Doctrine**  
  Humanity is seen as either a chosen species or as betrayers of an ancient covenant.

- **ONS**: Shares roots with some sects but denounces their extremism
- **PMFs**: Treats cults as unpredictable threats, deploys field suppressors near known enclaves
