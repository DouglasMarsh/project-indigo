# Terra Prima

## Overview

**Terra Prima** is a populist, Earth-first ideological movement that emerged in the late 21st century as orbital megacorporations and off-world colonies began to eclipse terrestrial power. The group believes that humanity's expansion into space is not a triumph — but a betrayal.

Terra Prima advocates for a return to Earth-centered living, environmental restoration, and the dismantling of orbital industrial systems. They view GLSS traversal, precursor tech, and post-gravitic economies as threats to human identity and planetary survival.

## Core Beliefs

- **Earth is Enough**  
  Humanity was meant to evolve on Earth, not abandon it.

- **Corporate Expansion is Colonialism**  
  Off-world settlements are viewed as elite-driven land grabs in vacuum.

- **Precursor Tech is a Corruption**  
  GLSS is not a gift, but a test or trap. True salvation lies in rejecting unnatural advancement.
