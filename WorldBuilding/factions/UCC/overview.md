# United Corporate Conglomerate (UCC)

## Overview
The United Corporate Conglomerate (UCC) is a powerful megacorporate federation formed through the strategic merger of several interplanetary banking, industrial, and logistics conglomerates. The UCC represents the interests of high-capital entities and seeks to impose a unified, efficiency-oriented order on the fractured post-collapse solar system.

## Structure
- **Governance:** Council of Executives, each representing a corporate bloc.
- **Legal Arm:** Enforces treaty frameworks and economic regulations via subsidiaries and legal proxies.
- **Security Division:** Maintains a standing fleet and elite security forces (e.g., Interdiction Wings, Corporate Security Auxiliaries).
- **Financial Control:** Uses debt acquisition and contract law to extend influence and acquire strategic assets.

---

## Strategic Philosophy
- **Control Through Legality:** Expands influence through contracts, debt purchases, and economic pressure.
- **Stability Through Consolidation:** Views independent alliances like the FDA as risks to systemic order.
- **Selective Aggression:** Justifies force as a last resort — typically paired with legal pretense or economic leverage.

## Role in the Battle of Kastra Reach
- Engineered RDIP-6, a covert operation to capture critical Cryohelion research from FDA-held Arc Signal Station K-6.
  - **RDIP-6A**: A visible deployment of the battleship *Resolute* to draw FDA defenders into a legal fleet engagement.
  - **RDIP-6B**: A deniable black-ops infiltration of K-6 under the cover of battle, with the goal of securing or destroying gravitic research.
- The battle succeeded tactically but failed strategically — the FDA successfully purged core data before the UCC could extract it.

## Legal Pretext: Delmas Station
- UCC covertly acquired the debt of FDA-aligned Delmas Station by purchasing the Kastra Mercantile Bank.
- This gave UCC a legal basis to deploy forces to “protect corporate property,” enabling the Resolute’s presence in Kastra Reach.

---

## Assets
- Flagship: *Resolute*, a dreadnought-class capital ship equipped with advanced ECM and gravitic shielding.
- Legal Holding: Acquired Kastra Mercantile Bank to leverage control over Delmas Station.
- Research Division: Pursues Cryohelion containment and weaponization, often via deniable programs.

## Reputation
- Feared and respected across the system.
- Seen by many as the inevitable successor to the old planetary governments.
- Criticized for monopolistic behavior, opaque internal operations, and use of black ops to circumvent treaties.
