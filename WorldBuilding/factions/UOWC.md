# United Orbital Workers Collective (UOWC)

## Overview

The **United Orbital Workers Collective (UOWC)** is a decentralized labor movement formed in the wake of the **Pallas Thermo Incident** (2071). It unites workers across orbital habitats, Belt mining outposts, Lagrange shipyards, and automated logistics networks into a multi-system cooperative.

The UOWC advocates for direct democratic control of orbital infrastructure, worker ownership of gravitic manufacturing, and protection from corporate overreach and exploitation.

## Core Ideology

- **Labor is the Backbone of Space**  
  Without technicians, miners, and transit crews, orbital society collapses.

- **Autonomy Over Allegiance**  
  The UOWC rejects allegiance to Earth governments or megacorporate charters.

- **Gravitic Equity**  
  Access to gravity-manipulating tech should be a universal right, not a corporate asset.

---

## Structure and Organization

- **Node Councils** — Local worker assemblies that govern each installation
- **Union Couriers** — Rapid-response communicators and mediators
- **Central Collective Signal** — Distributed voting and messaging network broadcast on encrypted RGP channels

---

## Origin and Formation

- **Pallas Thermo Incident (2071)**  
  A gravitic field collapse at a refinery station caused nearly 4,000 deaths. Corporate cover-up efforts failed, and survivors organized autonomously.

- First mass organizing broadcast from Vesta: “Orbit Belongs to the Builders.”

## Key Actions and Legacy

- **Ceres Framework Accords (2087)**: Formalized inter-node labor rights and safety protocols
- **Threshold Lockout Support (2112)**: Provided emergency aid during EXOS-led industrial quarantine
- **Outer Belt Transit Strikes (2116)**: Paralyzed six major supply lanes until arbitration recognized worker courts

---

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **PMFs**: UOWC views them as tools of oppression and strikebreakers
- **EXOS**: Treats EXOS with wary cooperation when disaster response or mediation is involved
- **Terra Prima**: Ideologically aligned in anti-corporate goals, but divided over Earth-centric rhetoric

---

## Cultural Symbolism

- The “Anchor Flame” — A stylized gravitic beacon with rising arcs of unity
- Common slogans: “Orbit for All,” “Welders Before Warlords,” “Strike the Sphere”
