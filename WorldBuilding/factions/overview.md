## EXOS (Expeditionary Operations Service)
A semi-autonomous interstellar peacekeeping and exploration agency originally chartered to stabilize conflict zones following the Hygiea Siege. Composed of scientists, explorers, and strategic specialists. Functions as both a UN analogue and an enforcer of off-world protocols.

---

## ONS (Order of the Nine Sparks)
Mystical and scientific hybrid sect formed in the wake of public Precursor ruin confirmation. They interpret gravitational anomalies, Precursor geometry, and GLSS activity as evidence of a spiritual or cosmological order — and humanity’s place within it.

---

## UOWC (United Orbital Workers Collective)
A radical labor coalition born from the aftermath of the Pallas Thermo Incident. Organizes habitat workers, belt miners, and freighter crews into decentralized unions. Often aligned with Belter autonomy groups and post-national collectives.

---

## Terra Prima
A populist, Earth-bound political and cultural movement. Opposes corporate dominance in orbit and GLSS exploration. Promotes environmental recovery, technological restraint, and human-scale societies. Known for rhetorical extremism and violent splinter cells.

---

## PMFs (Private Military Forces)
Security arms of megacorporations. Technically independent, but operate as corporate militaries. Deployed to protect assets, enforce economic claims, and suppress unrest. Maintain fleet-scale logistics and access to early GLSS traversal tech.

---

## Tech Cults
Fragmentary spiritual movements interpreting Precursor tech, GLSS geometry, and gravitic phenomena as divine or metaphysical. Often driven by visions, leaked science, and recovered Precursor texts. Includes:
- **Radiant Veil** (light-as-salvation)
- **Threshold Communion** (jump as spiritual rebirth)
- **Nine Sparks Revivalists** (derived from ONS, more radical)
