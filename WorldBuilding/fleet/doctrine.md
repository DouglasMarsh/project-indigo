# Fleet Doctrine

Space battles in this era were brutal, slow dances. Fleets maneuvered by prediction, not reaction. Battleships fired spinal coilguns to kill at extreme ranges. Missile trains dumped saturation waves to drown defenses. Point defense ships layered coilgun and laser walls to protect capital assets. Command ships managed the missile clouds, while ECM ships blinded and confused enemy fleets. Deep space chess. Every mistake paid for in blood and steel.
