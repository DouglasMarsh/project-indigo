## Fleet Roles

Fleet roles define the operational function of a vessel within a larger combat or exploratory group. Roles may overlap with hull classifications but are primarily determined by mission context, fleet doctrine, and outfitting.

### 1. Command Vessel
- Acts as the strategic and tactical command node.
- Equipped with advanced sensor, communication, and coordination systems.
- May be a dedicated command ship or a variant of another hull (e.g., command cruiser).

### 2. Capital Combatant
- Includes battleships, dreadnoughts, or other heavy line ships.
- Forms the core firepower and durability of the fleet.
- Designed for direct engagements and fleet anchoring.

### 3. Fire Support
- Provides long-range missile or energy weapon support.
- Includes missile cruisers, artillery platforms, and gravitic lance ships.
- Operates behind the front line.

### 4. Escort
- Protects high-value units from smaller, fast-moving threats.
- Role can be filled by frigates, destroyers, or flak cruisers.
- May also include point-defense and anti-fighter capabilities.

### 5. Screening
- Engages enemy screens, scouts, and fast attack units.
- Disrupts enemy formations and isolates vulnerable targets.
- Often fast and maneuverable ships like destroyers.

### 6. Reconnaissance
- Collects sensor data ahead of the fleet.
- Includes stealth ships, scout frigates, or ECM vessels.
- May operate independently or in picket formations.

### 7. Electronic Warfare
- Disrupts enemy sensors, targeting, and communications.
- Provides sensor fusion, jamming, and cyberattack support.
- Includes dedicated ECM ships or EW-configured frigates.

### 8. Carrier Operations
- Launches and supports aerospace assets (fighters, bombers, drones).
- Acts as a force projection and area denial platform.
- Requires escort and logistical support.

### 9. Logistics & Support
- Includes tankers, repair vessels, hospital ships, and tenders.
- Maintains fleet endurance and field operations.
- Typically not frontline combatants but may carry defensive systems.

### 10. Special Operations
- Covert insertion, sabotage, or precision strike roles.
- Involves stealth ships, infiltration corvettes, or black-ops platforms.
- Operates under separate command chains when needed.

### 11. Orbital and Station Defense
- Monitors, gun platforms, or heavily armed static defense ships.
- Lacks independent FTL or maneuver capability.
- Provides anchoring firepower around key installations.
