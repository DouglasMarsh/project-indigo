## Fleet Roles and Tactical Doctrine

This file defines the non-faction-specific fleet roles that govern operational use of ship systems, drones, strike assets, and support platforms across the pre-GLSS era.

### Strike Drone Doctrine Limitations

Strike drones are not mainline weapons in the current technological era. Despite the potential for autonomous deployment and terminal guidance, they face critical limitations:

- **Payload Efficiency**: Each strike drone takes up as much space as dozens of missiles.
- **Operational Risk**: Complex, high-value, and recoverable in theory—but rarely retrieved.
- **Target Saturation**: To reliably hit a fleet target, thousands of missiles are preferred over a few drones.
- **Power Constraints**: Cannot mount energy or kinetic weapons due to mass and energy requirements.

Strike drones are surgical tools, not frontline workhorses.

### Strike Drone Platform Design

**Role**: Mobile missile pod carrier, capable of autonomous strike under ECM and battlefield clutter.

**Size**: ~25–35m  
**Mass**: 400–700 tons  
**Payload**: One missile pod (multi-missile or warhead variant)  
**Control**: Pre-programmed mission logic, rarely recalled  
**Launch Method**: Carrier or heavy cruiser launch bay  
**Return Probability**: Very low

A strike drone is a missile truck with a brain. It does not engage in sustained combat.

### C2 / Telemetry Drones

**Purpose**: Tactical fire control relays used to guide missile swarms through ECM or degraded sensor fields.

**Function**: 
- Provide last-minute targeting data.
- Extend sensor coverage beyond fleet-safe zones.
- Mimic autonomous terminal guidance while retaining fleet control.

**Design**:
- **Size**: 5–10 meters
- **Mass**: 5–30 tons
- **Signature**: Extremely low; designed for silent operation
- **Power**: Just enough for sensor ping, encrypted datalink

**Deployment Modes**:
1. **Prepositioned**: Launched in advance, drifting in passive mode
2. **Swarm-Embedded**: Rides in missile swarm and activates just before impact
3. **Gravitic Assist**: Uses gravitic wakes or launcher boost
4. **Remote Boost, Passive Glide**: Pre-launched by tender, no burn signature

These drones make missile swarms viable in ECM-heavy environments without exposing command ships.

### Tactical Drone Doctrine: Autonomy and Control

Due to ECM and signal degradation, drones operate under semi-autonomous frameworks:

- **Mission Trees**: Logic-based instruction sets activated by triggers.
- **No Real-Time Piloting**: Bandwidth and latency make this infeasible.
- **Fallbacks**: If comms are lost, drones shift to default behavior modes.

Even UCC drones are not fully reprogrammable during flight—only modular logic stacks can be activated.

### Strike Drone Role Matrix

| Class      | Target             | Length   | Mass    | Role                          |
|------------|--------------------|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Tactical   | Frigate            | 20–30m   | 100–300t| Interdiction, PD distraction  |
| Strike     | Cruiser            | 30–50m   | 300–800t| Precision strike platform     |
| Siege      | Dreadnought/Station| 60–100m  | 800–2000t| Capital ship suppression      |

### Strike Drone vs. Missile Doctrine

| Feature            | Missiles       | Strike Drones             |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Launch density     | High           | Low                       |
| Cost per hit       | Low            | High                      |
| Mid-course update  | Limited        | Moderate (via C2)         |
| Terminal accuracy  | High (with C2) | Very High (pod-guided)    |
| Magazine cost      | Minimal        | Heavy                     |

Missiles remain dominant. Drones only make sense when intelligence, ROE constraints, or exotic warheads require decision logic.

### Final Note
Strike drones carry pods — not direct firepower. They are best thought of as intelligent couriers, not warfighters. Most tactical drones in the pre-GLSS era fall into ECM, sensor, or C2 roles — with strike drones reserved for high-risk, high-value precision work.
