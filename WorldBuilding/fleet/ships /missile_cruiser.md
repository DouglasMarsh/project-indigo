# Missile Cruisers

Missile trains were space tugs hauling death. Chunky, wide-bodied ships carrying dozens of missile pods. Didn't guide missiles directly. Released pods into battlespace and ceded control to C2 ships. 8:1 ratio of standard to heavy missile pods. Standard pods carried 10 light missiles. Heavy pods carried 1â€“2 siege missiles. Fire everything, hope someone else wins.
