# Battleships

Spinal-mount monsters like the Revenant and Eradicator classes. 2 km long, 1 million tons. Designed to deliver one decisive 500mm slug at 0.05c every minute. Armor wasn't to stop hits. It was to survive the saturation long enough to fire. Battleships didn't maneuver. They drifted. They lined up the shot. They erased enemies.
