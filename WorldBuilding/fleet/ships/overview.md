# Pre-Grav-Drive Fleet Overview

The Pre-Gravitonic Drive era fleets were built around reaction drive limitations. Battles were decided by mass, momentum, sensor control, and deep-space saturation fire. Big ships fought with massive coilguns. Smaller ships saturated the battlespace with missiles and noise. Survival came from prediction, not armor. Fleets were not beautiful. They were bricks thrown with precision into the black.
