# Gravitonic Lance Weapon Systems

## Bomb-Pumped Gravitonic Lance Systems

The Bomb-Pumped Gravitonic Lance represents an evolution in directed spacetime weaponry, leveraging the collapse energy of a Cryohelion lattice to produce devastating, focused gravitic attacks.

### How it Works

- A seeded Cryohelion micro-lattice is harmonically primed to near-collapse.
- At the moment of collapse, specialized containment and lensing fields capture and direct the released gravitic energy.
- The collapse energy is shaped into a narrow, coherent pulse or lance directed at the target.

### Ammunition Chain

- Each firing cycle consumes a single-use Cryohelion micro-lattice round.
- Micro-lattices are pre-grown with harmonics tuned for rapid collapse and maximum energy output.
- These lattices do not require long-term stabilization, making them simpler to manufacture but still extremely costly.

### Benefits

- Extreme Penetration
- Massive Instantaneous Power
- Minimal Signature

### Challenges

- One-Shot Use
- Containment Precision
- Heat and Stress
- Resupply Dependence

### Summary

Bomb-Pumped Gravitonic Lances transform collapsing Cryohelion into weapons of pinpoint destruction, hurling singular moments of broken spacetime across the void to unmake their targets.
