# Gravitonic Node System Overview

## Overview

The Gravitonic Node System revolutionized gravitic drive engineering by replacing single-core Cryohelion drives with multiple distributed nodes.

Instead of one massive Cryohelion lattice driving all spacetime curvature, ships are equipped with many smaller Cryohelion nodes, each producing localized gravitational pulses. These pulses are precisely timed and combined to form a unified thrust or stability field.

## Key Features

- Multiple Nodes: Small Cryohelion lattices spread across the ship.
- Pulse Coordination: Each node produces directional gravitational pulses, harmonized to combine into larger fields.
- Redundancy: Loss of one or several nodes does not result in total system failure; surviving nodes can rebalance.
- Manufacturing Advantages: Smaller cores are easier to grow and mass-produce after the introduction of Self-DeHarmonization technologies.

## Timeline Placement

Approximately 150–200 years after Alpha Centauri GLSS discovery (around 2285–2335).
