# Gravitonic Node Propulsion Systems

## Stacked Gravitonic Nodes (Gravitonic Coilgun Effect)

Stacked Gravitonic Nodes represent an advanced propulsion strategy where multiple gravitic pulses are sequentially timed along the ship's structure, resembling the staged acceleration method of a coilgun rather than a continuous railgun-like push.

### How it Works

- Nodes are aligned along the shipâ€™s structure.
- Each node fires a localized gravitic pulse in sequence.
- Sequential firing stacks gravitational distortions, building up compound acceleration.

### Benefits

- Higher Peak Acceleration
- Energy Efficiency
- Redundancy
- Dynamic Thrust Shaping

### Challenges

- Timing Precision
- Structural Strain
- Wave Reflection Risks

### Summary

Stacked Gravitonic Node propulsion allows ships to surf spacetime more efficiently, climbing gravitational hills created ahead of them by precise pulse orchestration, enabling faster, more agile movement without massive single-core systems.
