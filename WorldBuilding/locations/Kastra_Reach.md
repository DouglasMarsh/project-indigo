## Overview

Kastra Reach is an outer-system zone composed of loosely affiliated orbital platforms, transit lanes, and deep-belt access points. Originally charted for low-grade mining, it grew into a hub for semi-legal trade and precursor salvage.

During the Pre-GLSS period, it was the site of several key events, most notably the Battle of Kastra Reach and the destruction of Arc Signal Station K-6.
