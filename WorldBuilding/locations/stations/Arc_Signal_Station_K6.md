# Arc Signal Station K-6

**Location:** Kastra Reach (Outer-System Belt)  
**Era(s):** Pre-GLSS, Collapse & Recovery  
**Faction Affiliation:** Frontier Defense Alliance (FDA); currently held by UCC  
**Status:** Captured / Occupied

---

## Overview
K-6 is a concealed black-site research facility constructed within the excavated remains of a nickel-iron asteroid mining operation. Originally operated by the FDA, it supported experimental Cryohelion research while remaining off official charts. Its location and design made it ideal for covert science and deniable logistics.

---

## Strategic Role
- **Primary Function:** Research into Cryohelion-based gravity manipulation.
- **Secondary Function:** FDA fleet coordination node, precursor salvage analysis, and off-ledger logistics.
- **Facilities:** Core containment chamber, sealed lab bays, hidden docking moorings, and internal power lattice network.

---

## Notable Events
- **RDIP-6B Infiltration:** Targeted by UCC covert ops during the Battle of Kastra Reach.
- **Core Data Purge:** FDA personnel initiated a full research wipe and thermal burn protocol to prevent data capture.
- **Station Capture:** UCC forces secured K-6 intact following FDA evacuation or capture of remaining personnel.

## Current Status
Now held by the UCC, K-6 remains operational under the stated purpose of providing regional security for Delmas Station and curbing illegal activity formerly conducted through K-6's unregistered networks. The FDA did not issue a formal protest of the seizure, due to the stationâ€™s unofficial black-site designation and otherwise unremarkable location within the belt.

**Commanding Officer at Time of Capture:** Lt. Cmdr. Rena Halvik  
**Research Oversight:** Dr. Evi Marrin (deceased)
