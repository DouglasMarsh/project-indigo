## Overview
Delmas Station is a mid-sized toroidal orbital facility located on a stable resource transit lane near the outer Kastra belt. Originally constructed as a mining and trade support hub, it fell into decline due to mounting debt, lax oversight, and association with black market logistics.

---

## Strategic Role
- **Function:** Commercial logistics, transshipment hub, and unofficial black market port-of-call.
- **Economic Profile:** Deeply indebted; its controlling shares and outstanding bonds were covertly acquired by UCC via the Kastra Mercantile Bank.
- **UCC Leverage:** Provided legal pretext for deployment of *Resolute* under RDIP-6A.

---

## Notable Events
- **Legal Asset Flip:** Transitioned from FDA-aligned independence to UCC leverage without direct engagement.
- **Battle of Kastra Reach Staging:** Served as the formal justification for UCCâ€™s strategic military entry into the region.
- **Post-Battle Occupation:** Reorganized under UCC corporate jurisdiction; majority of former operators displaced or absorbed into UCC sub-holdings.

## Notes
While not tactically significant, Delmas remains symbolically important. It is often cited in post-collapse policy debates as an example of corporate predation through financial mechanisms.
