**Summary:**  
The Battle of Kastra Reach remains the most significant early military engagement demonstrating operational Gravitonic weaponry. Archival gravitic field telemetry confirms that the FDA Breakwater deployed an energized Cryohelion core weapon, reaching critical harmonic failure and inducing a gravitic collapse centered on the UCC Resolute Authority.

**Findings:**  
- Gravitonic field distortions exceeded predicted containment models by 21.4%.
- Primary collapse shockwave disabled four adjacent cruisers and several orbital installations.
- Cryohelion warhead destabilization signatures were positively matched to seeded lattice profiles manufactured at the Aurora Gravimetrics Facility.

**Implications:**  
This engagement forced the first formal EXOS hearings on Gravitonic Arms Control and initiated secret development programs within multiple Core World military forces.

**Notes:**  
Surviving FDA records cite the deployment as "an act of desperation, not of conquest."  
Public commemoration services for the fallen are held annually at the Breakwater Memorial in New Cambridge.
