# Broken Stars

####  — FDA Breakwater - Bridge

"Vampire\! Thirty-seven mark minus five, two-niner-three thousand klicks, point-one-c\!"

The words hung in the air for a moment, unreal.

Captain Zania Jackson barely registered them.  
The bridge of the Breakwater felt too small, too stale.  
The recycled air tasted of metal and old sweat, thick with the sharp bite of ozone from overtaxed electronics.  
Her skin prickled beneath her uniform, soaked through with four days of tension and no real sleep.

Around her, the bridge crew moved with the stiff, brittle discipline of exhaustion.  
Radiation alarms blinked on the periphery; static cluttered the sensor feeds.  
The atmosphere was saturated with the low, aching hum of systems pushed beyond their limits.

But that call—those numbers—stabbed through it all. Wrong. Impossible.

She sat frozen for one precious heartbeat, the comms channel open in front of her, her fingers hovering dumbly over the transmit key.

"Target volume—Centerline. Flagship in path," Tactical confirmed, too professional, too flat.

Zania’s gaze locked onto the tactical display, where the Pride of Hygiea still gleamed steady and golden.

A flash.  
A ripple.  
The Pride vanished in a silent, blinding bloom that sent radiation warnings shrieking across every console.  
The Breakwater shuddered as the wavefront washed over her shields, turning half her displays to static.  
She tasted the ionized air, bitter and sharp.

"She's gone," someone whispered. It might have been her.

A strange, dragging weight pressed down on her chest.  
This wasn’t supposed to happen.  
This was supposed to be a raid, not a war.  
She wasn’t even supposed to be here—Breakwater was a research ship, a testbed for a new drive system, not a line-of-battle heavy.

She blinked hard, forcing her eyes back to the displays. Her mouth was dry; her palms slick.

"Resolute-class," Tactical said next, voice dry as paper. "Launch platform confirmed as Resolute-class at forty-nine niner thousand klicks."

Noise cluttered the bridge: clipped reports, error codes, a sensor technician cursing under their breath.

"They have a goddamn Resolute-class battleship? How?"

For a week, they had danced with the encroaching UCC fleet, trading missile fire ,drawing them deeper into FDA space, away from their supply ships, burning their mass, depleting their ammunition. In the week they knew there partner well, sampled there emissions profiles, monitors stores expenditures. This was a well know partner and when the volume of fire from their Hellstorm missile platforms slackened, Admiral Hammon had turned — forcing the distance to close, eager to bring his heavier direct-fire capability to bear.

And now he, and the 2,300 other souls aboard the Pride, were gone. Murdered by the unknown from a seemingly well know foe.

Do something, her mind whispered.  
What? Why?

She wasn't a combat captain. She hadn't trained for fleet action, for coordinated fire plans and emergency maneuvers at relativistic range.  
She ran surveys, field tests, independent research missions.  
She had never stood on the knife-edge of annihilation before.

Another alarm wailed — radiation pulse, new vector incoming. Probably more rounds in flight.

Zania turned, almost instinctively, to the one man who hadn't frozen.

Her XO, Commander Halverson sat at his station, hands folded neatly on his lap, patiently waiting.  
His face was lined, his uniform rumpled, and his eyes — sharp and dark — locked onto hers with steady patience.

"Orders, Captain," he said, voice low but firm. "Flag is gone. You have fleet command."

Fleet command. How?

She suddenly remembered her conversation with Admiral Hammon, his casual comment that she was next in seniority — rank and time in grade.

She opened her mouth. No words came.

She shook her head slightly without meaning to. "Halverson, I—I’m not—"

His voice gentled even further, almost kind, almost fatherly:

"Zania. You are now fleet command. You’re all they’ve got."

She stared at him, breathing shallowly, feeling the shape of the universe tilt around her.

"They’ll follow you," Halverson said, just a little roughness in his voice now. "If you lead."

Behind him, she saw the flashes of dying ships, the desperate evasive burns, the scattered fragments of the fleet she was supposed to save.

Zania Jackson closed her eyes, just for a second, and let the fear pass through her like a breath.  
When she opened them again, her hands were steady, her mind focused.

She turned to Halverson again. "Suggestions, XO?"

He smiled, faint but genuine. "We need to steady them, ma'am. Give them time to consolidate and recover.  
We can run — not forever, but for right now, we can run."

Zania nodded. A way forward clear in her mind.

She hit the fleetwide comm switch.

"All fleet elements, Breakwater assuming flag. Center on me. Evasion pattern Drunken Master."

It was a decision.  A start.

####  — FDA Breakwater - Virtual Flag Room

The VR environment was clean.  
Too clean.

Captain Zania Jackson stood at the head of a long, polished table in a command conference room that didn't exist — a product of Breakwater’s tactical projectors and the fleetnet trying to paper over harsh reality.

The simulated wood-paneled walls gleamed without flaw.  
The virtual overhead lighting was soft, warm, soothing.  
The air — if it could be called that — hummed with a steady, calm background note designed to reduce cognitive stress.

It was a cruel joke.

Outside this illusion, the FDA fleet was burning at 3g. Ships screamed forward on emergency drives straining against structural tolerances.  
Zania's real muscles trembled against the harness straps biting into her uniform.  
Her body ached from the continuous crush of acceleration.  
And her fleet — her people — were breaking.

The avatars seated around the virtual table were crisp and neat, untouched by strain.  
But Zania knew the truth behind each projected figure.

Commander Halverson, her XO, sat stiff-backed, arms folded before him as if nothing was wrong.  
Tactical Officer Saito leaned forward slightly, tension betrayed only by the twitch of one VR-rendered eyebrow.  
Chief Engineer Malek looked clean and efficient — but in reality, she knew he was strapped to a crash couch, surrounded by overheating reactor panels.  
Science Officer Voss fidgeted with her tablet, her projection serene while her body probably shivered from adrenaline backlash.

And Chief Medical Officer Dr. Enzo Calder — whose white-pressed uniform in the simulation couldn't hide the grimness of his face.

Zania cleared her throat. The sound was crisp, surgically perfect in the virtual space.

"Status," she said simply.

Halverson inclined his head toward Calder first.

The CMO’s voice was measured, professional — far too professional.

"We have seventy-two reported injuries across the fleet," Calder said.  
"Majority are musculoskeletal: sprains, dislocations, compression fractures.  
Eight compound fractures from acceleration slips. One fatality aboard Kestrel — Lieutenant Diaz, bridge crew — secondary impact trauma during evasive burn."

A flicker ran down the table — stiffened backs, jaw muscles tensing, clenched hands.

"We're treating and stabilizing as fast as we can," Calder finished quietly. "But the situation will worsen the longer we hold three-g."

Zania nodded once, expression flat.

"Tactical," she said.

Saito pulled up a tactical overlay. In the VR, the fleet’s formation bloomed in faint blue arcs — ships weaving through randomized fractal evasion patterns.

"Drunken Master is holding, ma'am," he said. "No hits from the Resolute since the Pride."  
He touched three gray icons with two fingers, shrinking them to markers.

"But... Huntress, Orion's Light, and Springtide are gone.  
Mobility kills. Caught by fractal shots from enemy heavy cruisers — .025c mass drivers.  
They're not dead yet, but they're out of the fight. Probably captured."

Zania said nothing. She let the weight of it settle.

Saito continued, voice dry.

"Current fleet differential: four-nine-three thousand klicks.  
Delta-V closure: climbing slowly — about eleven klicks per second and trending up."

"They're pushing harder," Halverson said quietly.

Zania turned to Malek.

"Engineering?"

The Chief Engineer’s avatar remained expressionless, but his voice carried a faint rasp.

"Breakwater's holding steady," he said. "Our rebuild gave us margin.  
But the older hulls — the Morningstar, the Solace, even the Vigilant — they're showing stress faults under continuous 3g. And War Emergency Power isnt making the reactors too happy either.  
He grimaced.  
"Cracking in frame joints, fluctuating mass driver rails, heat sinks degrading faster than projections and I really dont like the fluctuation were seeing in Morningstars number 2 reactor.

He paused, voice tightening.

"Captain, if we keep this acceleration profile for another hour, two are the outside, we start losing ships to mechanical failure. Not enemy fire."

The room — the simulation — remained serene, artificial.  
Zania could almost hear the difference between this polished calm and the groaning, overstressed bulkheads outside her real command chair.

Her stomach turned.  
There were no good choices.

She looked around the table.

"We're bleeding ships," she said. "We can't slow down. We can't hold this evasion pattern forever."

Saito shifted forward slightly.

"We could turn and fight, ma'am," he said. "Before they squeeze us down to their optimum range."

Halverson's gaze flickered, but he said nothing.

"Head-on engagement would cost us," Saito added.  
"Maybe a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe worse."

Zania tapped her fingers once on the smooth table that wasn't there.

"There has to be something else."

The silence grew thick.

It was Science Officer Rena Voss who finally broke it — her voice small but clear.

"There... might be another option, Captain," she said.

All eyes turned to her.

Voss swallowed, lifted her chin slightly.

"The cryohelion drive package," she said.  
"The experimental system we were en route to test."

Zania frowned.  
"What about it?"

Voss shifted awkwardly in her seat, the VR rendering smoothing it into a neat posture — but Zania could feel the tension anyway.

"I've spent time... unofficially," Voss said carefully, "studying cryohelion field harmonics and stabilization.  
After the accidents during early core trials — the core bleed events, the rapid unplanned discharges — I started modeling potential failure cascades."

She hesitated.  
"It's only a theory, Captain. Nothing authorized. Nothing tested."

Zania leaned forward slightly, the virtual table cool against her palms.

"You're saying it can be weaponized."

"I'm saying..." Voss swallowed.  
"If we intentionally destabilize the core, force a harmonic amplification instead of damping, it might induce a runaway.  
A complete field inversion could cause a cascading energy release."

She looked up, meeting Zania’s gaze fully for the first time.

"But it's theoretical. Based on extrapolations.  
It explains the earlier containment failures better than the official models — but it's never been proven.  
We’ve never tried to trigger a runaway on purpose. But based on my projected output models, we should be able to cripple the Resolute.”

Malek grunted, dark amusement in his voice.

"Probability is low," Voss admitted.  
"But it's higher than winning a straight fleet engagement at current strength."

Zania leaned back slightly, feeling the harness in the real world bite into her shoulders.

"If we try this," she said slowly, "how long to make it fly?"

Voss checked her tablet, fingers twitching nervously.

"Twenty minutes to pull the core," she said. "Another twenty to reprogram the EM manager."  
She hesitated. "The biggest problem is launch. The core's too big to fit into any of our missile systems — even the Mjolnirs."

"What about one of the sampling probes?" Malek offered, voice rough.  
"Plenty of room if you pull the secondary sensor modules."

"The probes are slow as hell," Saito pointed out, scowling. "They're not built for anything but drift work."

Zania looked around the table, weighing ghosts of other options.  
There were none.

"Probe it is," she said. "How long to prep one?"

Malek shrugged.  
"Pulling the sensor suite is a standard job. Ten minutes under normal gravity."  
He grimaced. "At three g’s? Call it thirty-plus. And someone's probably gonna get hurt doing it."

Halverson, quiet until now, spoke up.  
"We're already looking at all of us getting hurt, Chief. That doesn't change the math."

"And fitting the cryohelion core into the probe body?" Zania asked.

"We'll fab something up," Malek said. He looked across the table at Voss.  
"After you pull the core, we'll still have the X-511B power bus available. We can graft stabilization couplers onto that."

Voss nodded, but her avatar flickered slightly — nervous.

Zania caught it instantly.  
"What aren't you telling us yet?"

Voss shifted again, visibly uncomfortable even inside the simulation.

"With the primary sensor package intact," she said slowly, "I can program the probe to seek the Resolute. Use retriever mode.  
But... there's no way to initiate the reaction remotely. Not with our systems."

Zania's brow tightened.  
"Spell it out, Lieutenant."

Voss licked her lips.  
"It means we have to initiate the cascade here. On Breakwater. Before launch."

The room seemed to grow colder, despite the sterile calm of the VR.

Zania’s voice was low.  
"What exactly does that mean?"

Voss's hands clenched tighter around her tablet.  
"If we're lucky — we trigger cascade start, kick the probe out the door, and it finds the Resolute and latches on."

"And if we aren't?"

"It detonates during spin-up," Voss said simply.

A tiny glitch rippled across the virtual ceiling — a flicker matching the chill down Zania’s spine.

She looked around the table.  
Halverson. Malek. Saito. Voss.  
Waiting. Trusting.

The time for clean options had passed long ago.

Zania drew a breath.

"Prep the device," she said quietly.  
"Get me a launch system."

If they were going to die, they would do it striking.

Not bleeding.

#### FDA Breakwater - Science Lab, Bridge, Docking Bay

The Breakwater groaned around them, a living thing under constant strain.

In the real world, nothing was crisp or clean anymore.  
The air was thick with the stink of overheated composites, recycled sweat, and the burned-metal tang of stressed conduits.  
Bulkheads creaked. Structural members vibrated like deep-voiced instruments.

Malek crouched over the cryohelion core’s cradle, secured in a high-grav maintenance sling rigged against the engineering bulkhead.  
His gloves were slick with sweat inside the suit sleeves.  
Every motion had to be slow, careful, anchored —  
at three gravities, a misstep could tear muscle or break bone.

Voss stood braced across from him, tablet tethered to the core’s primary access port.  
The display flickered with raw system warnings as she prepared to strip the EM manager's safeties.

"Secondary dampers disengaged," Voss said, her voice cracking in her helmet mic.  
"Cryo stabilization holding... for now."

Malek grunted.  
He reached for the main linkage coupler, fingers fumbling slightly in the gloves.

"Pulling containment clamps now," he warned.

He didn't ask for permission.

With a groaning wrench of mechanical release, the cryohelion core slid free, pivoting slowly under its restraints.  
Tiny mist trails of cryogenic gas curled away from the connection points, sublimating instantly in the ship's heat.

Malek tapped his internal comms.

"Core is loose. X-511B bus still live. We're moving to transfer cradle."

Across the ship, Breakwater trembled again — another emergency evasion burn pushing her decks sideways by centimeters.  
A slow, groaning growl rolled through the bulkheads.

Zania watched the status feeds from the command bridge.  
She could feel the ship's heartbeat — ragged, strong, refusing to break.

"Status on the probe conversion?" she asked, tight one the shipsnetZ.

"Shell's gutted," Saito's voice came back from the drone bay, breathless with exertion.  
"We're rigging the main cavity for the core cradle now. Jury-rigged hardpoints — not pretty, but it’ll hold."

Malek’s hands were shaking as he sealed the emergency quick-release collar on the probe rig.

"Field reprogramming underway," Voss reported, tapping line commands with short, jerky motions.  
"Switching containment governor from damping to magnification.  
Minor errors in sync… clearing… clearing…"

Zania heard her own breath in her ears.

"Confirm when the EM manager is stabilized," she said.

"Working..." Voss muttered, teeth grinding audibly in the mic.

A new shudder ran through the Breakwater — not from engines — but from somewhere deeper.  
Structural shear alert on frame layer delta.

Zania felt the shift without needing instruments.  
The fleet was fraying.

They were running out of time.

#### FDA Breakwater - Bridge

The tactical overlay flickered against the main display, a forest of drifting icons — their fleet weaving under the chaos of Drunken Master.

It wasn’t enough anymore.

Zania stood rigid in her harness, feeling the ship groan beneath her boots, the constant three-gravity crush a second skin now.  
The Breakwater was holding — barely — but the smaller ships were beginning to scatter like wounded birds.

They no longer had hours, they had minutes.

She keyed the fleetwide net — full broadcast.

No preamble. No shield.  
Just her voice, raw and stripped of anything but truth.

\> "This is Captain Zania Jackson, fleet command.  
We've been running. We've been bleeding. We've survived — but it's been a false survival.  
Every evasive burn, every jink, every loss... it’s only delayed the inevitable."

"That ends now."

She let the silence stretch, let it sink into the bones of every ship.

"We have a chance. Slim — but real.  
Better a single strike than being dragged down, one by one, into the dark."

"The wolves are at our door.  
It's time to show them we have teeth.  
Claws.  
And the will to use them."

"All fleet elements: prepare for turnover.  
Shift to Formation Shield Dancer.  
On my mark — we attack."

The acknowledgment codes flooded back almost instantly.  
No hesitation.  
They were ready — battered, bleeding, but ready.

Zania stabbed the command key.

\> "Execute."

On the main display, the fleet bloomed outward.

Phalanx-class frigates surged forward into a chaotic, layered lattice.  
Gladius-class light cruisers reinforced the weave, throwing randomized offset vectors.  
Archers drifted deeper into the mesh, their battered hulls concealed behind the madness of fractal movement.

Breakwater and the other heavies held rearline, pivoting around her like a wounded but still-fighting bodyguard.

The Shield Dancer pattern formed — a living, shifting storm of ships.

Behind them, Malek and Voss finished rigging the probe.  
The cryohelion core pulsed faintly inside the battered shell, containment fields flickering on the edge of overload.

Zania opened a channel to Engineering.

\> "Status?"

"Final validation check and we're loading the cradle," Malek growled.  
"thirty more seconds and we’re ready."

Thirty seconds.

It could have been eternity.  
Or nothing at all.

\---

They never got the full thirty.

Breakwater shuddered violently, throwing Zania hard against her restraints.  
Pain flashed through her side.

\> "Impact — midframe, portside\!" Saito shouted from tactical.  
"Mass-driver hit\! Glancing blow\!"

Warnings flooded the displays.  
Structural strain alarms, power redistribution faults.

\> "Damage?" Zania barked.

Malek's voice came back a heartbeat later, grim and furious.

\> "Launch cradle’s compromised. Primary sled offline.  
No powered throw."

Silence.  
The probe would drift.  
Obvious. Slow.  
A dead man walking.

Zania tasted blood in her mouth.

\> "Options, Chief."

Malek didn't hesitate.

\> "We rig a manual spring-tension throw. Jury-rig it dirty and hard.  
It'll look like a bad missile launch — maybe junk.  
Maybe they ignore it."

Zania looked across the bridge.  
Everyone was watching her.  
Waiting.

She keyed her mic.

\> "Do it. Now.  
Get me that launch."

Voss’s hands shook as she locked the final EM cascade commands. The cryohelion lattice song, also present a low background frequency began to grow the harmonies oscillating, building.  
Malek and his team scrambled to fit mechanical tensioners into the warped sled cradle.

Outside, the Shield Dancer formation spun and twisted — a living cloud of confusion masking the crippled heart beating at its center.

Zania watched the seconds bleeding away.  
Each one a prayer.  
Each one a blade pressed against the fleet’s throat.

They had one chance.

And they were taking it.

#### FDA Breakwater - Bridge

The tactical plot bled red across the bridge display.

The Shield Dancer pattern, once a brilliant, living web, was breaking apart under the hammer blows of closing fire.  
The range was collapsing — from four hundred thousand klicks to three hundred and falling fast.

Ships winked out of formation — crippled, burning, dying — faster than comms could register.

Names scrolled down the loss feed in a relentless waterfall:

Solace — hull breach, drive loss.

Morningstar — venting atmo, reactor instability.

Falcon’s Reach — no contact.

Vigilant — destroyed.

Every few seconds, another name.

On the tactical map, a Gladius-class light cruiser — Resolute Promise — staggered violently, breaking formation.  
A .025c slug had caught her midship, tearing through plating and airlocks, snapping her spine in half.  
She drifted, tumbling, bleeding bodies into the black.

Another flash — blinding even across half a million kilometers.  
One of the heavies — Dauntless Blade — simply vaporized,  
the Resolute-class battleship finding a clean line at last, punching a main-gun slug straight through her command core.

The fleet was melting before her eyes.

Zania stood at the center of it, fists locked on the edges of her console, feeling the ship shudder under the continual burns, the endless stress.

She opened the tightbeam to Engineering.

\> "Status, Chief?"

Malek’s voice came back — raw, panting, furious.

\> "Ten minutes, Captain."

Ten minutes.

An eternity.

A death sentence.

She didn't have ten minutes.  
She didn’t even have five.

Another explosion blossomed on the edge of the display.  
Another scream of a reactor dying in the dark.

More death.  
More destruction.  
More blood spilled into the black.

Zania locked her jaw against the helplessness clawing at her throat.  
There was no room for it now.

Minutes dragged by, every second a blade shaving away their chances.

She watched another ship — Stormchaser — fall out of Shield Dancer, spiraling, drive plume flickering, burning.  
No one would recover them.

Not now.

Not ever.

Her hands dug into the crash padding of her chair until the material creaked.

And then — after what felt like a lifetime,  
Malek's voice snapped across the fleetnet, cutting like a blade.

\> "It's done, Captain. Launch ready\!"

Zania didn’t hesitate.

She punched the fleetwide net — open broadcast.

\> "All fleet elements — fire all remaining munitions. Everything you have.  
Launch pattern Avalanche.  
Launch, launch, launch\!"

The response was instant.

Across the broken weave of the Shield Dancer formation, battered ships coughed fire into the void.  
Missile pods ignited.  
Railguns spat ragged slugs.  
Degraded autocannons threw their final rounds.

Every surviving launcher on every surviving ship fired — even if it wasn’t properly targeted, even if it wouldn’t hit anything.

It didn’t matter.

It was noise.  
It was fury.  
It was a desperate, glorious shield.

And inside that storm of fire —  
hidden among the tumbling, erratic missile arcs and kinetic shells —  
a tiny, jury-rigged probe, carrying the unstable cryohelion core, kicked free from Breakwater’s damaged sled mount.

Zania watched it arc outward.

Not fast.  
Not clean.  
But moving.

The fleet burned itself dry in the sky — a final blow cast into the dark.


#### Aboard the UCC Battleship Resolute

Admiral Harlan Reyes leaned lazily against the smooth railing of the Resolute's flag bridge.  
The air was crisp and clean, every surface immaculate, every system purring along at one standard gravity.  
His uniform was spotless.  
A bulb of fresh-brewed coffee floated near his hand, tethered by a magnetic field for easy sipping.

The tactical display showed the FDA fleet disintegrating nicely — scattering wreckage and desperate, broken ships peeling away in futile evasion.

\> "Pathetic," Reyes thought, watching another FDA destroyer tumble into nothingness.

The bridge around him was calm, cool — quiet murmurs of trained officers calling updates in the background.  
Everything was smooth.  
Disciplined.

Efficient.

Exactly as it should be.

When the final FDA salvo erupted — that messy, half-hearted flood of missiles and rail slugs — Reyes merely smirked.

\> "Ignore it," he told his tactical officer, casually waving a hand.  
"Target only clean threats. Let them exhaust themselves."

And then, one contact caught his eye.

Bravo-Niner-Seven.

Tumbling. Erratic.

\> "Visual magnification," he ordered.

The screen zoomed.  
A battered survey probe. No warhead. No clear drive signature.  
Just broken drift.

Worthless junk.

Reyes sipped his coffee.  
The FDA were dying, and they had the gall to throw garbage at him on their way out.

\> "Fitting," he thought.

The probe closed the last few kilometers, kissing the edge of the Resolute's long-range sensor shadow.

Still no detonation.

Still no signature spike.

A dispatch officer half-turned from their console.

\> "Captain, Bravo-Niner-Seven impact imminent. No detonation events."

Reyes shrugged, about to wave it off entirely —  
when the screens began to flicker.

\---

#### Probe Three-Two-Seven-Bravo

There was no thought.  
No hesitation.

Only command:

\> FIND AND RETRIEVE SOURCE: EM SIGNATURE 1713A59H7T. 

The AI locked onto the target signature, shivering with perfect, simple joy.  
Thrusters fired — tiny puffs of gas nudging course corrections.

Contact.

Touch.

Magnetic locks engaged.

\---

#### Cataclysm

It was not an explosion.

There was no flash of fire.  
No kinetic shockwave.

There was only collapse —  
space folding inward in an instant —  
the instantaneous birth of a microscopic black hole.

The Resolute didn’t shatter.

It unmade.

Atom by atom, molecule by molecule — pulled apart into a singularity so small it should not have been, so heavy it should not have existed.

Admiral Reyes barely had time to gasp before the blackness swallowed him whole.

And then —  
with a noise that no human ear could fully comprehend —  
space screamed.

A counter-note — a white hole — erupted outward, hurling a standing gravitational wave across the battlefield like a hammer blow from a broken god.

The UCC fleet crumpled under the impact.

Ships twisted apart, frames folding like paper.  
Reactors detonated.  
Spinal mounts snapped like twigs.  
Entire heavy cruisers simply vanished under the onslaught.

\---

#### FDA Breakwater - Bridge

For a moment there had been dispare. She watch the tactical plot say the improbable happen the probe made it, through a hellstorm of fire it attached. 5 seconds, 10, 20, She turned to Voss \- how long

And it happened.

Even two hundred forty thousand kilometers away, Breakwater shuddered like a dying animal.

Structural members groaned and buckled.  
Magnetic containment fields on the reactors fluttered — collapsing for microseconds and snapping back with painful whines.

Gravity became a suggestion, then an accusation.

Stars smeared across the forward viewport in impossible arcs before stabilizing.

The smell of burned insulation filled the bridge.

But they were alive.

Somehow — barely — they were alive.

Zania gasped against her harness straps, chest heaving.

She looked at the tactical plot through blurred eyes.

Where the Resolute had been —  
there was nothing.

No wreckage.  
No energy signature.  
No orbiting debris.

Just a rent in space — an ugly, wrong wound where the stars flickered wrong, shadows bleeding across the void.

For a long moment, it seemed over.

Then —  
bits of the Resolute flickered back into view —  
half-shredded chunks of plating and framework phasing in and out of existence, spasming between realities.

It pulsed.  
Twitched.

Until, finally, reality stabilized — ragged, raw, screaming silently across a hundred million kilometers.

Zania closed her eyes against the sight.

And a quiet near inaudible whisper from Voss. “What have I done.”

—

#### Epilogue

\---

The stars were wrong.

Rena Voss floated around the remains of Breakwater’s bridge, the ship creaking under its own wounded weight. At rest, engines thrown into emergency shutdown.  
Outside the battered ports, the heavens twisted, smeared faintly at the edges — a slow, painful scar cut across reality itself.

The Resolute was gone.  
The UCC fleet was gone.

What remained of the FDA fleet drifted like the tattered wreckage of a dying world.  
Less than a third of their original numbers answered her first recovery calls.  
Even fewer could maneuver under their own power.

The last tactical plot flickered and failed in the corner of her vision.  
No more threats.  
No more targets.

Only silence.

And the scar.

The place where space screamed without sound — where fragments of the Resolute still tried to exist and failed, flickering in and out, forever incomplete.

Rena closed her eyes.  
The cold ache behind her ribs didn’t fade.  
Victory was a word too clean, too empty, for what they had achieved.

They had survived.

And in surviving, they had become something else.  
Something smaller.  
Something heavier.

She didn’t know what price they had paid yet.

She didn’t know if anyone ever would.

But deep in her bones, Rena knew the truth no report, no briefing, no political spin could erase:

Something was broken now.

"The stars won't forgive us," Rena thought, watching the scar burn against the black.
