*Mining Hauler Red Rook, Outer Belt — July 3, 2117*

He came back to himself with the sound of static in his ears.

Not the soothing kind, like on an old vidcast. This was sharp, needling — like space itself was whispering in binary.

Daryn Hesse blinked against the dim lighting of the ship’s sick bay. The overhead panels flickered in a slow, uncertain pulse. One eye wouldn’t open all the way. He felt pressure behind it, like something was pushing *out*.

“Vitals stabilizing,” came the low voice of MedUnit-9. The nursebot hovered at the edge of the bunk, gently adjusting the IV collar clamped to his neck. “You experienced a systemic neural event. Three minutes of unconsciousness. Minimal organ damage. Do you recall what happened?”

Daryn opened his mouth, closed it again.

“Drive coil,” he rasped finally. “It was hot. The emitter array… misaligned. It shouldn’t have activated.”

“It did,” the nursebot replied. “Telemetry shows a 7.3-second gravitic burst at coil frequency 13.5 Theta. You were within three meters.”

He sat up slowly. That was *impossible*. Theta bands were theory-only — unstable graviton harmonics that could tear shielding like foil. He should be paste, not alive.

“You’re sure I’m not dead?”

“Your current condition is suboptimal but improving.”

He stared at the bot for a long time. Then past it.

**He could feel the ship.**

It was subtle. But real. He sensed the thrum of the stabilizers. The minute shift in rotational inertia as the *Red Rook* drifted past a debris cluster. It wasn’t hearing. Wasn’t touch. It was just… *presence.*

“MedUnit,” he said slowly. “What’s the crew doing right now?”

“Captain Korr is on the bridge. Koji is on EVA. Del Raan is sleeping.”

He blinked. “Koji’s tether line is drifting too far starboard. It’s… tight.”

The bot made a soft clicking sound as it accessed live feeds. “Confirmed. Crew member Koji’s tether is extended beyond recommended parameters. Auto-reel engaged. How did you—”

“Dunno,” Daryn muttered. His hand shook. The IV collar itched. “I just… *felt* it.”

His vision rippled for a second — no, not vision. Space itself rippled. A warping blur around the far wall. Like gravity had twitched, just for him.

“Something’s wrong with me.”

“Correction,” the bot said flatly. “Something is different.”

“Your EKG reading at the time of injury shows severe arrhythmia consistent with full cardiac arrest. However, your neural activity did not cease.”

“What?”

“Electroencephalographic patterns remained active throughout the incident. Your brainwaves deviated from human baseline approximately 2.4 seconds after the drive activated. Theta-dominant resonance with emergent gamma harmonics. Sustained for 11.3 seconds.”

“You’re saying I flatlined… but my brain didn’t.”

“Correct. The event cannot be explained using current human neurological models. You are exhibiting traits consistent with previously documented cases of GIND-S.”

“That’s spacer folklore.”

“It is a classified condition. But no longer theoretical. There are nine confirmed instances in Terran medical archives. All linked to prolonged or high-intensity exposure to graviton field anomalies.”

His hand brushed the wall — and the diagnostics screen flickered behind him. Not touched. Just… responded.

“Notify the captain,” he said.

“Request denied. Per Directive 311.4c: In the presence of suspected graviton-induced neural divergence, command authority is revoked pending psychological evaluation.”

“You’re grounding me?”

“I am preventing potential escalation. You are exhibiting unpredictable neurological effects.”

A low hum echoed through the bulkhead — a gravitic shudder, slight but unmistakable.

“Was that me?” he asked.

The bot hesitated.

Daryn’s jaw clenched.

“I’m not a risk,” he said. “I *am* the warning.”

### *Main Corridor, en route to Engineering*

The ship breathed with him.

Daryn walked barefoot through dim corridors. With each step, systems flexed around him. The *Red Rook* was alive. And her rhythm was wrong.

It was a song. Each conduit, each relay, had its own tone. The drive’s dissonance howled beneath it all. A broken chorus of strained machines crying for balance.

Access panels opened for him. Lights dimmed where he walked. He didn’t command. He invited.

---

### *Lower Engineering Deck*

By the time he reached the final corridor, the air was shimmering with field interference. His skin tingled with the edges of warped gravity. His breath caught at odd intervals, his body struggling to anchor itself in a frame of reference that kept shifting.

Still, he walked.

The containment corridor was a strobing hell of sound and gravity. The emitter throbbed, glowing with unstable energy that ebbed and swelled like tides breaking through a crumbling seawall.

He stood before it and closed his eyes.

The discord washed over him again — louder now. Frantic. Desperate.

He let go.

His thoughts, his breath, his fears — released into the field like vapor. And the coil responded. It shifted. Buckled. Then reached back.

They met.

And for the first time since the drive malfunctioned, the field **paused**. Not stable. Not fixed. But *listening.*

The song was no longer screaming.

It was waiting to be brought home.

### *The Repair*

Daryn stood alone before the pulse coil, and for a heartbeat, the world stilled.

Then he began to hum.

It wasn’t a melody he knew. It rose from his throat instinctively — low, uncertain at first, then stronger. It moved with the drive’s rhythm, counterpointed the discord in the chamber, filled in the spaces where the field wavered. He could feel it resonating down into the hull, out into the bulkheads, into the systems that made up the ship’s spine.

He raised his arms — slow, fluid, like a conductor before an unseen orchestra. Not commanding. *Inviting.*

And the field responded.

A swirl of gravitonic force bloomed around the coil — invisible to the naked eye, but not to him. He saw it as strands of motion, arcs of distorted intention, like threads waiting to be woven back together. The humming deepened. He closed his eyes.

As he moved, the field moved.

As he sang, the field sang.

The misaligned frequencies began to bend toward him. Like frightened animals drawn by warmth. Like wayward voices looking for home. One by one, they fell into sync — sharp notes softened, harsh echoes found their match. The gravitational ripples that once tore at the chamber now folded inward, wrapping around him like a cloak of static and light.

The hum inside him became a chord.

The ship's energy subsystems dropped from critical.

The stabilization field spiked — then held.

Somewhere above, on the bridge, Captain Korr and Koji watched in stunned silence as the redlined drive diagnostics flickered green, one by one.

**Daryn’s hands lowered.**

The chamber exhaled.

The coil dimmed.

He opened his eyes slowly, and the silence that followed was not empty. It was full — of balance, of breath, of completion.

The ship had found its harmony.

And so had he.
