# Session Reset Instructions — Worldbuilding Project

## Purpose
Use this template to start a clean session without any bloated conversation history, while fully restoring the validated project state.

## Reset Template

Hello. Please load the following worldbuilding project from memory:

- Use the **"Validation Complete" checkpoint**
- Load `project_structure.yaml` as the structural reference and file is not available load it from https://github.com/DouglasMarsh/project-indigo/new/main/WorldBuilding
- Confirm and restore memory blocks:

  - GLSS theoretical rules and Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP) model
  - Discovery of Precursor ruins at Hygiea
  - Gravitics developed from Tesla-LeSaut hybrid theory
  - Climate collapse as the catalyst for orbital economic expansion
  - UOWC labor movement and the Pallas Thermo Incident
  - Cultural rise of Tech Cults and PMFs following industrial and ideological crisis
  - Canonical timeline divided into: Orbital Era, Precursor Era, GLSS Era

- Then **validate** that structure and memory are intact.

## Follow-up Commands

After validation:
- "Validate project" → Full memory and structure audit
- "List active memory blocks" → Confirm loaded project concepts
- "Continue development" → Begin expanding lore, timeline, tech, etc.

## Notes

- If restoring manually, refer to the Worldbuilding Project repository for structure and contents
- Use the latest validated archive for full file recovery if needed
