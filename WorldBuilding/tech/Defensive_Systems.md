# Defensive Systems

## Overview

Defensive technologies in the GLSS-connected era fall into three main categories:
- **Passive Defense** (materials, design)
- **Active Defense** (shields, point-defense)
- **Electronic/Gravitic Countermeasures** (ECM, gravitic scattering)

These systems are deployed across civilian habitats, escort craft, megaships, and precursor-adjacent containment vessels.

## 1. Passive Defense

### 1.1 Armor Composition
- **Multi-layered Titanide Composites**: Standard for hardened habitats
- **Ablative Ceramics**: Used in high-velocity reentry systems and kinetic interceptor vessels
- **Graphene Foam Hull Inserts**: Reduces penetrative shock, doubles as radiation damping

### 1.2 Structural Redundancy
- Pressure compartments now include **“burst-lock” frames** that automatically seal and isolate hull breaches.
- Habitat rings use **shock-distributed rail mounts** to mitigate impact forces and gravitic stress.

## 2. Active Defense

### 2.1 Shielding Systems
- **Magnetoplasma Envelopes**: Provide temporary directional shielding against high-energy pulses and EMP
- **Particle Bloom Fields**: Deployed against high-momentum kinetic rounds; vaporizes incoming projectiles

### 2.2 Point-Defense Arrays
- **Autoturret Constellations**: Operate in swarm logic, coordinated via ship AI for intercept efficiency
- **Micro-rail Cannons**: Fast-cycling, small-caliber mass drivers used in close defense clusters

## 3. Countermeasures and Gravitic ECM

### 3.1 Sensor Disruption
- **Chameleon Coating**: Refractive nano-layering that mimics cosmic background signature
- **Echo Spoofers**: Launchable decoys that replicate EM and gravitic signature returns

### 3.2 Gravitic Field Interference
- **RGP Scatter Nets**: Interfere with localized gravitic detection by distorting Remote Gravitational Pull vectors
- **Cryohelion Damping Cells**: Used to suppress residual gravitic harmonics in Precursor-affected zones

## Deployment Contexts

- Civilian habitats generally use passive and ECM; only major corp assets have access to high-grade shielding.
- EXOS and some PMFs maintain full-spectrum defense loadouts, particularly near contested GLSS Points.
- Cult enclaves favor sensor disruption and Precursor-based dampers over traditional hull armor.
