# Gravitics and Field Theory

## Overview

Gravitics in this universe stem from the fusion of 21st-century theoretical physics with rediscovered principles embedded in Precursor ruins. The dominant framework is the **Tesla-LeSaut Synthesis**, which redefines gravitational interaction as an exploitable field through resonance manipulation and mass-coupled geometry.

## 1. Tesla-LeSaut Synthesis

- **Tesla’s Lost Notebooks** (recovered in the 2040s) proposed gravitic influence as a harmonic function of spatial potential.
- **LeSaut Principle (2073)** formalized the math, suggesting graviton alignment and wave interference could induce controlled curvature in spacetime.
- The synthesis enables **non-inertial propulsion**, artificial gravity, and the detection of Remote Gravitational Pull (RGP).

## 2. Cryohelion Discovery

- A bio-reactive crystalline structure found in Precursor ruins near Hygiea.
- When exposed to low-temperature electromagnetic fields, **Cryohelion resonates with localized RGP fluctuations**.
- Allowed humanity to build the first **graviton contouring fields**, enabling fine-tuned GLSS alignment and containment.

## 3. Applications

### 3.1 Propulsion
- **Field-thrust engines** generate vectorized gravity differentials, allowing maneuver without reaction mass.
- Ranges are limited by generator mass and harmonization delay.

### 3.2 Containment and Lab Use
- Used to **stabilize Precursor artifacts** and limit unintended leakage or waveform resonance.
- Deployed in EXOS quarantine rings and PMF “black labs.”

### 3.3 Navigation
- Enables **GLSS vector alignment** for safe traversal.
- GLSS entry now requires precise gravitic alignment in 3D space relative to projected stellar offset.

## 4. Theoretical Models

- **RGP Theory**:  
  RGP = (Mass / Distance²) × ε  
  Where ε is leakage efficiency, generally < 0.01

- **Resonant Mass Coupling**:  
  Stars with near-equal mass values create stronger, stable GLSS links. Supported by Cryohelion harmonic tests.

## 5. Political and Cultural Effects

- Considered **sacred** by ONS and various tech cults
- Terra Prima calls it “the gravitational heresy”
- UOWC advocates for **open-source gravitic access**, while PMFs treat grav field data as proprietary weapon-grade tech
