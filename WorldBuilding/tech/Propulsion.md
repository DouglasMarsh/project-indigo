# Propulsion Systems

## Overview

Propulsion in the GLSS-connected era is divided into three primary categories:
- **Chemical and Fusion** (legacy and backup)
- **Gravitic Drive Systems** (mainline use)
- **Specialized Low-Thrust or Exotic Systems** (used in unique roles)

Gravitic systems are now dominant in intra-system and GLSS-adjacent operations, but traditional technologies still see use in edge colonies and high-risk environments.

## 1. Chemical Propulsion

### 1.1 Applications
- Used on frontier systems, lifeboats, and emergency orbital insertion
- **Favored by Terra Prima** and low-tech colonies for its simplicity and independence from advanced tech supply chains

### 1.2 Limitations
- High fuel-to-thrust inefficiency
- Heat dissipation and radiation signature expose trajectories

---

## 2. Fusion Drives

### 2.1 Usage
- Common in mid-century freighters and long-range exploration ships
- Used as backup on gravitic-equipped vessels

### 2.2 Output Characteristics
- High-endurance burn profiles
- Shielding and reactor cycling required for crewed missions

---

## 3. Gravitic Drives

### 3.1 Theory
- Manipulate local gravity gradient vectors using graviton field generation
- Based on **Tesla-LeSaut synthesis** and harmonized Cryohelion emitters

### 3.2 Characteristics
- Reactionless
- Near-silent in vacuum
- Primary driver for orbital industry growth and GLSS accessibility

### 3.3 Limitations
- Range is still constrained by harmonics and generator mass
- Gravitic harmonization takes time â€” not suited to agile combat maneuvers without advanced compensation rigs

---

## 4. Exotic and Hybrid Drives

### 4.1 Ion-Singularity Mesh Drives
- Used by EXOS and long-haul PMF convoys for automated logistics chains
- Combine slow-acceleration ion rings with cryohelion-linked micro-warp fields

### 4.2 Solar Rail Kinetics
- Experimental cargo deployment system using orbital rails and solar bloom collectors
- Abandoned in inner systems but still maintained on Titan, Eris, and Vesta

## Strategic Implications

- **UOWC** maintains gravitic-capable haulers with fallback chemical assist
- **PMFs** deploy gravitic-inertia nullifier bursts for intercept vectors
- **Cultists** often incorporate spiraling or non-inertial motion in symbolic rituals and GLSS alignments
