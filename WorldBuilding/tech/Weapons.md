# Weapons Systems

## Overview

Weapons technology across the GLSS-connected era incorporates conventional, electromagnetic, and limited energy systems. Practical combat in orbital and interstellar environments favors high-efficiency, low-signature, and hardened delivery systems due to the fragility of habitats and the consequences of missed engagements.

## 1. Projectile-Based Systems

### 1.1 Conventional Kinetics
- **Chemically propelled slug weapons** remain in use among frontier colonies, militia groups, and low-tech installations.
- Reliable, manufacturable, and simple to repair.

### 1.2 Mass Drivers
- Coilguns and railguns use electromagnetic acceleration.
- Found on capital ships and hardened outposts.
- Common in PMF suppression arrays and EXOS standoff interceptors.

## 2. Directed Energy Weapons

### 2.1 Pulse Lasers
- Rarely used in infantry combat; typically mounted on station defense rings.
- Efficient at long-range in vacuum but limited by capacitor recharge rates.

### 2.2 Microwave Lances
- Used for **drone swarms**, **sensor interference**, and in **close-quarters hull melting** applications.
- Effectiveness scales inversely with atmospheric density.

## 3. Electromagnetic Disruption

### 3.1 EMP Grenades
- Popular in boarding operations and riot control; disables exo-suits and light drone rigs.
- Deployed by EXOS personnel and sometimes UOWC resistance cells.

### 3.2 Magnetoplasma Bursts
- Radiant discharge systems used to overwhelm shielding for brief windows.
- Occasionally weaponized by GLSS cults in ritual “initiation duels.”

## 4. Symbolic and Ritual Weapons (Cult Use)

- **Gravity-Attuned Swords**: Use minimal field emitters to create vibratory or resonant edge harmonics.
- **Jump-Forged Blades**: Weapons constructed or “consecrated” at the moment of GLSS traversal.
- Seen among elite ONS Revivalists and Threshold Communion ceremonial guards.

---

## Tactical and Political Considerations

- **EXOS** enforces tiered weapon protocols based on GLSS proximity and artifact sensitivity.
- **PMFs** prioritize suppressive fire, containment, and hull compromise tools.
- **Terra Prima** favors physical weapons to avoid corporate tech dependencies.

---

## Deployment and Restrictions

- GLSS-adjacent systems often invoke **“no-EM” zones** around active precursor sites.
- UOWC mandates weapon parity policies for all habitat contracts, especially against PMF escalation.
- All directed energy weapons are banned within 100 km of active cryohelion chambers by EXOS treaty.
