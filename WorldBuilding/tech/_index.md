# Technology Index

This index links to the modular technical systems that define propulsion, weaponry, defense, and gravitic manipulation across the GLSS-connected universe. These modules replace the legacy `TECH_BIBLE.md` and provide expandable documentation for all major technological domains.

## Modules

- [Propulsion](Propulsion.md)  
  Covers gravitic, chemical, fusion, and ion-based drive systems, including limitations, fuel dependencies, and maneuvering capabilities.

- [Weapons](Weapons.md)  
  Describes projectile-based, electromagnetic, and energy weapons used in infantry, vehicle, and capital ship roles. Includes usage restrictions and escalation protocols.

- [Defensive Systems](Defensive_Systems.md)  
  Documents shield configurations, hull materials, ECM capabilities, and reinforcement strategies across civilian and military applications.

- [Gravitics](Gravitics.md)  
  Explores the LeSaut-Tesla synthesis theory, Cryohelion effects, gravitic field generation, containment, and precursor-inspired adaptations.
