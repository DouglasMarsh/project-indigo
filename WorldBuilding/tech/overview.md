# Technology Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the technological foundations of the GLSS-connected universe. It is designed as a lightweight reference for worldbuilding, faction design, and storytelling without requiring the full technical module to be loaded.

## Purpose of the Tech Module
The tech module catalogs all major technological systems relevant to spacefaring civilizations in the post-Precursor era. It supports canonical consistency across weapons, propulsion, gravitic science, and defensive systems.

## Major Domains

### Propulsion
- Includes chemical, ion, fusion, and gravitic drives.
- Civilian craft use reliable low-output systems; military vessels may use unstable but powerful experimental drives.
- Maneuvering limitations often define tactical viability.

### Weapons
- Projectile and EM-based small arms are standard.
- Energy weapons are restricted to power armor, support vehicles, and capital ships due to energy demands.
- Some systems integrate precursor tech enhancements.

### Defensive Systems
- Passive: advanced hull materials, thermal baffles.
- Active: electromagnetic shielding, ECM suites, and gravitic field distortion.
- Effectiveness varies significantly between factions and tech access.

### Gravitics
- Derived from safe, controlled Cryohelion effects.
- Enables inertial dampening, containment fields, artificial gravity, and localized graviton shaping.
- Universally deployed in advanced starships and stations, though its theoretical basis remains incomplete.

### Cryohelion Technology
- The foundational phenomenon behind all gravitic manipulation.
- Involves cryogenic field collapse, exotic mass states, and spacetime discontinuities.
- Precursor ruins in the asteroid belt suggest Cryohelion was once part of advanced containment and field manipulation systems.
- Human breakthroughs began circa 2170 following analysis of artifact cores retrieved from shattered planetoids.
- Gravitics (e.g. inertial dampening, artificial gravity) are controlled applications of Cryohelion effects, filtered through modern containment fields.
- Full Cryohelion systems remain rare and dangerous — prone to instability, field bleed, and psychotropic side effects in exposed personnel.

## Precursor Influence
- Nearly all breakthroughs in gravitic and field-based tech originate from recovered precursor artifacts.
- Reverse-engineering remains fragmentary, leading to inconsistent implementation.
- Some factions consider precursor tech semi-religious or strategically classified.
