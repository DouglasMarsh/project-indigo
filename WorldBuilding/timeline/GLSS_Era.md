# GLSS Era (2184+)

The GLSS Era begins with the **confirmed detection and traversal of the first Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularity** (GLSS) in the Oort Cloud, linking Sol to Alpha Centauri A. It marks the official start of **stable, repeatable interstellar travel** and the onset of cultural, political, and technological fragmentation on a galactic scale.

## Key Events

### 2184 — DGVS Breakthrough
- Directional Gravitational Vector Sensors (DGVS) reach sufficient sensitivity to detect GLSS-scale RGP fields.
- EXOS deploys first deep-range survey arrays.

### 2189 — First GLSS Discovered
- GLSS between Sol and Alpha Centauri A confirmed via gravitational anomaly triangulation.
- Initial detection misattributed to “Planet X” by pre-modern observers.

### 2190 — First Jump
- An EXOS-controlled probe completes the first successful GLSS traversal.
- Jump leads to temporary communication blackout due to orientation mismatch.

### 2192 — Alpha Centauri Outpost Established
- Modular habitat placed near GLSS egress point.
- Cultural and temporal drift between Sol and Alpha Centauri begins.

### 2195–2210 — Expansion Phase I
- GLSS links between Alpha Centauri → Sirius, and Sirius → Procyon are established.
- A network of wormhole-enabled outposts is formed.
- Precursors re-enter philosophical and political discourse on a planetary scale.

## Cultural Shifts

- **Cult Proliferation**: ONS Revivalist movements and Threshold Communion gain new members and regional power.
- **Corp Fragmentation**: Megacorps begin to diverge ideologically and operationally between systems.
- **Earth Isolationism**: Terra Prima factions achieve partial Earth governance influence, triggering anti-jumppoint legislation.

---

## GLSS Network Stabilization

- A GLSS-linked system is now referred to as part of a **Resonant Corridor** if more than three active GLSS exist within 20 light-years.
- Navigation laws, travel protocols, and GLSS zone treaties begin to standardize under EXOS mediation.

---

## Emerging Threats

- **Gravitic Detonations**: Experimental jumps and resonance tests trigger unintended spatial warping in near-Sirius space.
- **Precursor Echo Zones**: Data anomalies near stable GLSS suggest unknown Precursor observation or defense systems may still be active.

## Future Outlook

The GLSS Era is expected to accelerate:
- Cultural divergence between star systems
- Competition for control of GLSS junctions
- Deeper archaeological revelations that may challenge humanity's autonomy
