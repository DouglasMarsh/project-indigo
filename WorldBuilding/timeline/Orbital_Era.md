# Orbital Era (2040–2100)

The Orbital Era marks the transition from Earth-bound civilization to a partially spacefaring industrial society. Triggered by climate collapse, economic desperation, and technological breakthroughs in orbital autonomy, this period sets the stage for megacorporate ascendancy and deep space labor economies.

## 2040–2050: Terrestrial Crisis and Space Bootstrap

- **2041** — Earth's environmental tipping point reached: ocean acidification, dust-belt storms, and mass species collapse.
- **2043** — International cooperation on climate begins to fail; orbital power becomes privatized.
- **2047** — Cryohelion first identified in a gravitic anomaly survey probe lost near Hygiea.

## 2050–2070: Orbital Industrialization

- **2054** — *Chrysalis Collapse*: Experimental biofab using Cryohelion suffers cascade failure; results in 260 deaths and public exposure of gravitic potential.
- **2062** — First permanent orbital city funded by a megacorporate union: SunSpire Habitat.
- **2067** — Autonomous mining swarms reach Ceres, marking full robotic industrial capability in the Belt.

## 2071–2080: Conflict and Class Fracture

- **2071** — *Pallas Thermo Incident*: gravitic field collapse kills ~3,800. Leads to formation of the UOWC.
- **2076** — Earthside populations begin food ration riots; global governance dissolves into resource syndicates.
- **2080** — EXOS proto-agency is established as peacekeeper and scientific protocol enforcer.

## 2081–2100: Ruins, Revelation, and Realignment

- **2083** — Precursor ruins discovered near Hygiea; humanity realizes it is not alone.
- **2084–2085** — *Hygiea Siege*: Multiple factions deploy near the ruins. Leads to militarization of space, formation of EXOS as permanent force.
- **2087** — Terra Prima begins forming into an organized Earth-first political entity.
- **2093** — Cryohelion containment breakthroughs allow non-destructive graviton field replication in lab conditions.

## Era Summary

The Orbital Era ends with:

- The collapse of Earth-bound authority structures
- The rise of megacorporate and labor-led polities in space
- Humanity’s awareness of Precursor civilizations
- The foundational groundwork for GLSS theory and exploration in the next era
