# Precursor Era (2083–2184)

The Precursor Era is defined by the **discovery of alien ruins near Hygiea** and the rapid, chaotic transformation of human society in response. It bridges the industrial rise of orbital civilization with the dawn of gravitational science, and lays the ideological foundation for the GLSS Age.

---

## 2083 — Precursor Ruins Discovered

- A gravitic anomaly survey probe investigating an asteroid cluster near Hygiea stumbles on artificial structures.
- Ruins include impossible geometry, harmonic mineral latticework, and graviton flux traces.
- Multiple factions attempt simultaneous recovery; containment and weaponization fears spread.

---

## 2084–2085 — Hygiea Siege

- Armed standoff erupts between PMFs, EXOS precursor teams, and cultist pilgrims.
- Standoff ends in mediated containment agreement; ruins remain under EXOS jurisdiction.

---

## 2087 — Rise of Terra Prima

- Earth-based populists form a political coalition opposing further space expansion and GLSS experimentation.
- The phrase “Earth is Enough” enters global political lexicon.

---

## 2090s — Early Gravitic Synthesis

- Tesla-LeSaut gravitic theory is formalized using field samples from Cryohelion artifacts.
- Fusion of terrestrial physics and alien mineral behavior leads to first **stable RGP simulations**.
- Begins divergence of industrial research and cult metaphysics.

---

## 2100s — Cultural Fragmentation

- **Threshold Communion**, **Radiant Veil**, and other cults emerge.
- **Cryohelion reactor accidents** lead to EXOS intervention treaties.
- **PMFs escalate tech hoarding**; black market for Precursor-derived materials explodes.

---

## 2110–2120 — Power Rebalancing

- Labor-led Belt syndicates like UOWC force corporate recognition of autonomous orbital zones.
- EXOS expands mandate and establishes the **Gravitic Risk Directorate**.

---

## 2130–2180s — The Search for GLSS

- DGVS prototypes emerge; deeper gravity wells yield faint RGP echoes.
- Artificial alignment chambers built to simulate GLSS vectors.
- The scientific establishment recognizes the Sol → Alpha Centauri RGP anomaly as a possible wormhole candidate.

---

## 2184 — DGVS Breakthrough

- Detection confirmed.
- EXOS launches multi-vector mission to the Oort Cloud.
- This ends the Precursor Era and launches humanity into the GLSS Age.

---

## Era Summary

- Humanity transitions from discovery to ideological realignment.
- Religious,
