# Timeline Index

The history of the GLSS-connected universe is divided into three major eras. Each era is covered in its own document and outlines the relevant technological, political, cultural, and interstellar events that shaped the setting.

## Eras

- [Orbital Era (2040–2100)](Orbital_Era.md)  
  The rise of orbital megacorporations, climate collapse, and the first signs of post-terrestrial civilization.

- [Precursor Era (2083–2184)](Precursor_Era.md)  
  Discovery of Precursor ruins, ideological realignment, the fall of Earth-centric governance, and the emergence of GLSS-based theory.

- [GLSS Era (2184+)](GLSS_Era.md)  
  Begins with the discovery of the first usable GLSS in the Oort Cloud and launches the age of stable interstellar traversal.

## Notes

- Events are presented from the human point of view unless otherwise noted.
- All three eras overlap in influence; some events echo across multiple timelines.
- Factions, technologies, and cultures introduced in one era often evolve or fracture in the next.
