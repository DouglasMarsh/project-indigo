# Timeline Overview

This document summarizes the historical arc of humanity’s transition from a planet-bound species to a gravitationally networked interstellar presence. It is organized into three major eras, each reflecting key shifts in technology, ideology, and cosmic awareness.

## 1. Orbital Era (2040–2100)

### Key Themes:
- Earth’s environmental collapse and economic unraveling
- Rise of orbital megacorporations and worker syndicates
- Discovery of **Cryohelion** and the industrialization of low-gravity space
- First known **Precursor ruins** discovered near Hygiea

This era ends with humanity’s realization that it is not alone — and that gravitational phenomena are more than just theory.

## 2. Precursor Era (2083–2184)

### Key Themes:
- Ideological and religious fragmentation following ruin discoveries
- Creation of **EXOS** as a stabilizing peace-enforcement faction
- Emergence of cults, labor revolutions, and inter-corp warfare
- Theoretical formalization of GLSS (Gravitationally Linked Spacetime Singularities)

By the end of this era, GLSS are no longer theoretical — but detectable.

## 3. GLSS Era (2184+)

### Key Themes:
- First stable GLSS jump (Sol → Alpha Centauri A)
- Cultural divergence between star systems begins
- The GLSS network becomes a new map of human expansion, division, and rediscovery
- The question of the **Precursors’ role in the network** grows increasingly urgent

This is the current era. It is defined by the paradox of unlimited expansion — and increasingly fragmented identity.

## Timeline Principles

- Each era influences the others through lingering politics, cultural memory, and technology inheritance.
- No era has clean borders — all bleed into one another.
- The timeline is built from verifiable historical documents, speculative future events, and recovered Precursor telemetry when available.
